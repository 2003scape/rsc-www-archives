<P align=justify>But the peace breaks when a beer glass flies through a window of the messhall of Barbarian village. -No beer for you,until you pay your loan! the messhall keeper yells. -This place is not good! "loan"... Who cares about loans? Arfard says.Arfard is a normal barbarian... he likes beer a lot,and he is not very rich. -I care about loans! the messhall keeper yells back. 
<P align=justify>So Arfard wandered out of the messhall. He didn't have money to pay his loans,and he still wanted some beer,so he decided to go to look for some. 
<P align=justify>He decided to go to Varrock,because a traveller had said to him that the Blue moon inn has good beer. When he got to the Blue moon inn,he suddenly realized that he didn't have any gold pieces left. -Dammit... now where do i get money from,Arfard muttered. -I can do something for your thirst, a man from a corner said. The man had long gray hair,black shirt and yellow trousers. -Well,you want to buy me a beer?Arfard asked. -I'll buy you as much as you want,if you go away. You smell like a hobgoblin,the gray-haired man said. -Well,i'll smell like a black dragon if you buy me a beer. 
<P align=justify>So the gray-haired man bought Arfard five glasses of beer and sneaked away. When he was at the western bank of Varrock,he muttered to himself: Another task completed,and he smiled. 
<P align=justify>Arfard drank some of the beer. It tasted awful. He decided to sell the beers someone. He sold the beers for a thirsty adventurer,and he got fifty gold pieces for the beers. He went back to the Barbarian village,and paid his loans. Then he took more beer for loan. <BR>
