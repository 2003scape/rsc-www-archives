Dear Saradomin, <p align=justify>
The new aggresiveness of monsters is a pain!!! I
simply try to mine and they kill me!!!! I once had a
pick and a hammer and a mithril bar and the dwarves
would not leave me alone and they killed me!!! Now I
have nothing. Could you perhaps make the dwarves less
aggresive? I think you should, but as a humble
human I have no input....'sigh'.
<p align=justify>

<p align=justify> Make dwarves less aggressive? Whatever next? That's like
asking humans to stop complaining all the time. Anyway,
dwarves just wouldn't be dwarves if they weren't huffing
and snorting and shoving axes in your face. However, Andrew has just admitted to accidentally tampering with their water supply, which may have made them
particularly frisky of late. The plumbers have now been called.

Dear Saradomin,<br>
What has Runescape come to?! As I take me morning walk
through your Kingdom what do I always see? I always see
people standing in one spot may it be training, mining
or fishing and logging in and out. Obviously they are
using a cheat, macro, or autominer which is clearly
against the rules of Runescape. It is not fair on all of
us fair players who gain our XP fairly! I know you have
come up with that monster thing to stop some cheaters
but it does not stop the mining and fishing ones! I
think that The Team should come up with a way to stop
these cheaters once and for all!
</i>
<center><p>
<i>From your follower, Xterm2</i>
</center>
<p align=justify><table><tr><td>
Yes, everyone is tired of the cheaters that you
speak of. As such we are changing mining and fishing
shortly so that they no longer consist of hours of
tedious repetative clicking. They will be made more
fun, and harder to cheat. The rocks will be much
easier to mine, but you will need to rest or eat food
occasionally whilst mining. <p align=justify> The upshot of this is that honest
miners should be able to mine ore slightly quicker,
whilst the cheats will just have to go somewhere else.

To Saradomin, <p align=justify>
I have recently stepped into a new area, and saw a
strange man selling fancy dress. However, I was shocked
to see that he was selling a red party hat! Myself, and
many other runescape players believe that the rare items
such as hats, crackers, easter eggs, disc of returning,
pumpkins etc are great things to own, and show a great
symbol of wealth. However, it seems these are
deliberatly being "spoilt" for us. Can you tell us what
the future holds for such items, and if their status of
wealth shall be destroyed? <p align=justify>
Icedrop </font></i>
<p align=justify>
Yes, there has been a lot of interest in the fancy dress
shop and its red party hat. And if the shop-keeper was
actually able to get some in stock, I'm sure there would
even more. It seems that he has been advertising these
hats as some kind of cheap marketing ploy, to get
adventurers salivating in anticipation. It obviously
worked...

Dear Saradomin,
<p align=justify>
Recently i have been seeing hundreds
of people wearing 'Priest Robes'. People are trying to
sell them for ridiculous prices and when I ask where you
get them they don't answer. Where can I find these
robes? Are they some robes that have leaked out of
members? Or are they just a figment of my
imagination? Good day.

<p align=justify> No, you're not imagining it- they really do exist. You
can find them in south Varrock as part of the Biohazard
Quest.

O Mighty Sage,
<p align=justify>
Throughout the ages, archery has been the noblest
of skills. The merging of bow and arrow in a
coordinated effort to hit a target is a beautiful sight
to see.<br>
My concern is towards the attitudes of the other
citizens (especially the more youthful and vulgar ones)
who do not receive the archer so willingly.
Archery and magic are the two major skills where a
citizen can join into an established conflict, and
perhaps even come away as the ultimate victor. Rather
than investigate this ability and elevate their ranging
skills, the non-archers curse and attempt to banish the
archers. Granted, there are episodes where archers take
advantage and at times antagonize the non-archers
(although many of them deserve it), but it becomes a negative experience.
<p align=justify>
What can be done to both elevate the ranging skill and
help the non-archers to understand?

<p align=justify> As a god of peace, I am a firm believer in the value of
constructive dialogue. So please allow me to defer to a
more contrary voice on the matter.
<p align=justify>
<i><font color=white> Greetings Saradomin,
<p align=justify>
My suggestion concerns archers. It is great that we can
use bows and arrows as alternatives to getting our hands
dirty in melee combat, but I really cannot stand it when
I am fighting with my trusty dragon axe and an archer
comes along and steals some of my experience, shooting
the monster I am fighting. It is rude, and the same
goes for somebody starting a fight with a monster that
is already getting ranged. Could you perhaps make it so
that a monster cannot be attacked at all once it
has already been attacked?
<p align=justify>

<p align=justify>
Hmm, seems like we've got a bit of an impasse here.
Looks like you're just going to have to learn how to get
along. A prayer to prevent others from interfering with
your combat is however planned at some point in the
distant future.

<i><font color=white> Saradomin,<br><br> I have been a loyal and grateful worshipper of you for
almost a year and a half. I joined the members not
only to receive greater enjoyment but also to see the
world improve in many different ways. But as the game
gets increasingly more popular the servers become more
and more crowded. <p align=justify>
I believe it's time the members received a new
server. The free players have 3 times more than the
paying members. I know there are more players in the
free world but is it not time to give the loyal members
a server to spread the numbers over? <p align=justify>
Bladzer
</font></i></i> <p align=justify>
Your cry is a worthy one indeed, and low I am happy to
say that worlds 11 and 12 have now opened up.
11 will operate as a members server, and 12 will be for
non-members. <p>

<i><font color=white> Dear Saradomin,<br>
When I was just starting out on Runescape the
black hole was very popular. When I went to go try it
out it wasn't there. I want to ask you why the black
hole was taken out of the land of Runescape,and will it
ever be back?
<p align=justify>
Adikt
</font></i></i>
<p align=justify>
Well there are lots of theories about black holes, with
some professors claiming that they represent the origins
of evolution itself. But when you're a god you don't
like to harp on about the whole evolution thing too
much. <p align=justify>
In scientific terms, black holes represented the
world's first sin bin, banishing miscreants for all
eternity.Or at least for some of it. The only problem
was, the black hole developed such a reputation that
warriors were going out of their way to be plunged into
its eternal void. Those who had sworn blind to be
upright individuals now just swore blindly. Anything to
get thrown into the black hole. <p align=justify>
Only later did was it discovered that this was the
work of Zamorock, cleverly designed in order to
glamorise evil deeds. From then on the council just
banned people instead, and with no more matter to
envelop, the black hole turned in on itself and
imploded. <p>
<p align=justify>
<i><font color=white> Dear Saradomin,<br>
The world of Runescape is indeed evolving fast. There is
more to be found now than there was a year ago. And with
it, prices of newly introduced items are immensly high.
All these coins are piling up in bank accounts and
trades are getting really long. Would it not be a joy to
have value-paper? This would make trades a lot shorter.
A proposal: 1 piece of value-paper is worth 10,000 gold
coins.
<p align=justify>

<p align=center>
<img src=../../img/lov/god_letters/moneycert2.jpg width=301 height=141>
<p align=justify><font color=white>
Yes, this does seem like a good idea. I understand
that the powers that be will be implementing some kind
of bank note system in the not too distant future. Your
fiscal problems will soon be over! <p>
<p align=justify>
<i><font color=white> If anyone should want to pay to play
Runescape, I believe that they should only have to
pay $5 in their own currency. Such as in Australia, we
have to pay $10 Australian, which is about the
same as $5 American. Why should we have to pay more
to have the same rights as everyone in America? It's
the same as making someone do something to get into
a club when no-one else did. Why? Please make it fair
on us soon, I hope you can even this out.
<p align=justify>
Goodbye and ja bless,

<p align=justify>
Perhaps I spoke to soon before. Even the greatest
system of money is only as wise as the people who use
it. But as far as fairness is concerned, I can tell you
that $10 Australian is about the same as $5 American. <p>
<p align=justify>
<i><font color=white> Saradomin,
<p align=justify>
A couple of years ago, I was a newbie under the screen
name FF9Gamr and I got ripped off right when I started
(you probably knew since you are the god of RuneScape).
I started a file named IRipYouOff because I thought
nobody would ever try to rip me off. I am not respected
much and would like your thoughts on how to interact
with the RuneScape inhabitants.
<p align=justify>
IRipYouOff
<p align=justify>
</font></i></i>
Yes, that is a tricky one. All I know is, I wouldn't be
too happy about buying a second-hand camel from you. <p align=justify>
Until next time my faithful friends.
<p align=justify> Strength through wisdom,<br>
