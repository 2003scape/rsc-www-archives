<b>Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god Saradomin now regularly communicates with the inhabitants of this fast evolving planet. An agreement with his brothers prohibits him from directly intervening into Runescape's affairs, but in his great omniscience he still listens to the prayers of those who seek his knowledge.</b></td></tr></table>

<td> <p align=justify><i> Oh Ancient and Wise one,<br>
Firstly let me congratulate you on the incredible
new structure of mining. No longer do I stand bored,
hopelessly swinging my pick axe and making my arm and
'finger' ache. The ore is there and it's all mine mine
mine. In 42 levels of mining I never saw a gem, now
within 2 levels I have found 3. Sapphires sparkle but
diamonds are radiant.
<p align=justify> The fact that you must rest makes the realism so much
greater now. After all, unearthing gems can be
tiresome work. I offer a final prayer of hope that this system stays forever.

<p align=justify> <i>Yours admiringly, Aceaid</i>
<p>&nbsp;
<p align=justify>
Verily, it pleases me that you are so pleased.
Although I can't promise that there will be no more
developments. As my brother Guthix says, nothing lasts
forever. Except maybe diamonds.

<img src="../../img/lov/god_letters/bed-wildernesspic.jpg" width=250 height=180> </td><td> <i><font color=white><p align=justify> Dear Saradomin, <p align=justify> If there are no beds in the wilderness,why do you
continue to have the coal rocks? It's a waste of space
and its laggy. I once passed through there trying to
save myself from getting PK'ed but the lag made me
stop and the opponent seems to have continued moving
toward me and then killing me. I lost full rune but I
saved my r2h. Can you somehow tell Zamorak to make the
rocks dissapear? <p align=justify> mewp136
</font></i></i>
<p>
<font color=white><p align=justify>
Rest assured, there are now beds in the wilderness.
They can be found in the dark warriors' castle, in the
sapphire house and in the ruined town with the furnace
in it. Even PKers need to unwind sometimes.</td></tr></table>
<p>
<i><font color=white> <p align=justify> Dear Saradomin,
<p align=justify> I would like to know why you took the mithril ore
rocks out of the mining guild and dwarven mine. Now the
only place I can get mithril ore is in the wild where
people insist on killing me.
<p align=justify> Your loyal follower, <p align=justify> Chewy69.
</font></i></i>
<p align=justify> A good question. The mithril rocks respawn was
increased,which meant that they needed to be a long way
from a bed to stop them becoming too powerful.
<p align=justify> However, under the new hard rock / soft rock system you
can expect to see a couple of soft mithril rocks
making a return to the miners guild soon.
<p>
<p align=justify> <i><font color=white> To the almighty god Saradomin,
<p align=justify> On behalf of all the women of Runescape I humbly ask
that many of the clothing and armor that is only made
for the men, such as chainmail, robes, and aprons, can
be converted to fit the female gender. <p align=justify> With woman's robes we won't be at shame when we
worship you and are mistaken as a man, we won't
hide when presented with chainmail, and we won't shy
away from wearing aprons when we cook! Thank-you high
and merciful Saradomin. If you grant this wish the women
of runescape will never forget.
<p align=justify> Your loyal servant, Starzball
</font></i></i>
<p align=center> <table><tr><td>
<font color=white> <p align=justify>
Yes it's true that those unisex outfits do very little
for the female form. But a new line in fashion is being crafted even as we speak, and after the update these items will be available to all! Just don't feel obliged to do all the cooking. </font></td><td>

<i><font color=white> <p align=justify> To the great Saradomin
<p align=justify> In response to the explanation of null in the recent
newsletter.....
<p align=justify> I always thought null was a character in viewing
distance but not yet loaded onto your computers
memory.....call me a heretic....but...that would seem to
make sense.
<p align=justify> Josh F
</font></i></i>
<p align=justify><font color=white> How wrong you were! But don't worry, lots of people
are ignorant without being heretics. Although strangely
enough the mage Andrew doesn't seem to believe me either.
In fact he agrees with you, and says "When you first meet
someone in the game they will be called 'null' until the
server sends the name and appearance of that player to your
machine. Don't worry, it doesn't actually affect the gameplay."
<p align=justify> Until next time,
<p align=justify> Strength through wisdom,<br>
Saradomin
