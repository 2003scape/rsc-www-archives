<b>Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god Saradomin now regularly communicates with the inhabitants of this fast evolving planet. An agreement with his brothers prohibits him from directly intervening into Runescape's affairs, but in his great omniscience he still listens to the prayers of those who seek his knowledge.</i></td></tr></table>

Dear Saradomin,
<p align=justify>
When you up-date the new graphics system will I be
able to tell what weapon I'm using with out going
to the inventory. Because when I'm out in the wild pking
it's good to tell a rune long from a rune 2-h, or a
hachet from a battle axe. <p align=justify>

<p align=justify> <font color=white>
Yes, it's always nice to know what weapon you're
using when you're mashing it into somebody's
skull. Just promise me that said skulls belong to nasty
Zamorakian fiends who thoroughly deserve such
treatment. And even then, I don't entirely approve.
But to answer your question, yes, after the update you
will indeed be able to make this visual distinction. So
you won't feel like some novice who can't tell his axe
from his elbow.

Can't there be a training spot for ranged attacks?
Because I can't find a fast spawningpoint for rats.
<p align=justify>
Pauwelke <p align=justify> </i>Such a training spot does exist! But first you must
complete the Biohazard quest- and it's a biggie. So in
other words, you must work hard in order to gain the
right to train harder. A little puritanical perhaps, but
there you go. <p><i>
Dear Saradomin, <p align=justify>
There have been some rumours going around lately
about "sleeping bags," and the convenience of not
needing to rest on a bed when fatigue is high. Of course
I do not believe what everyone is saying, and I just
wanted to confirm that sleeping bags do not,in fact,
exist in the world of Runescape. <p align=justify>

I am happy to announce that sleeping bags are indeed the
stuff of myths. After going to all that trouble to make
beds work, we couldn't very well just let you miners
crash out next to the rocks- that would take us back
to square one! And I think it's nice to walk back home
for a well-earned rest.</td><td>

Dear Saradomin, <p align=justify>
As you know, the holidays are coming up and me
and other fellow Runescapers want to know what we
can expect to happen over the holidays. <p align=justify>

Well, everyone stop working for a few days, and the
population of turkeys takes a sharp nosedive. Is that
what you meant? Oh yes, and people have been known to
receive nice gifts, which appear seemingly at random on
a certain day of the year. But only if you're good, of
course.<p align=justify>

Dear Almighty One, <p align=justify>
I was defeating some black knights far away
in the mountains, and after a few hours I got
pretty bashed up. So I went to get cured by some nice
Monks who just happened to be around the corner.
I accidently clicked on one and started to kill him.
I reduced him to very low health and
stopped, he didn't want to continue, so I
talked to him, then he said, Yes, I will cure you. Why
do monks cure you after you kick the living
daylights out of them?
<p align=justify>

<p align=justify>
For all my omniscience, I am somewhat taken aback at how
you can accidentally start to kill someone. And I
imagine that the monk was a little startled as
well. But they are a forgiving bunch, which is why
they don't mind healing you after you beat them up.
Just try not to give them a complete pasting- they're
bound to run out of antiseptic cream eventually. <p align=justify>
Until next time my friends,
<p align=justify>
Strength through wisdom,
<p align=justify>
Saradomin
