<p><b>Terms and Conditions</b><br /></p> 
<p> This website is operated and maintained by Jagex Limited, a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706), whose registered office is 11 Sturton Street, Cambridge, CB1 2SN, UK and its suppliers and partners ("Jagex"). Jagex and Runescape are registered trademarks of Jagex Limited in the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries. </p> 
<p>Use of this website and the services provided via it are conditional upon you accepting the following Terms and Conditions. Unless otherwise specified, your acceptance shall be indicated by your use of this website. If you do not accept these Terms and Conditions, you must not use this website. </p> 
<p> <b>Definitions</b><br />"RuneScape" refers to both the main runescape game, and the runescape-classic version of the game. Both versions of the game use the same account, and the same Terms and Conditions apply to both of them. </p>
<p> <b>RuneScape Account</b><br />To play RuneScape or use many features of this website, we require you to create an account, and choose a username and password. </p>
<p>You must not choose a Username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, or which is deliberately confusing or which is offensive, racist, obscene or otherwise unlawful. We reserve the right to change any Username for any reason. </p> <p>You agree to keep your Password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You must ensure that your computer is kept free of viruses and Trojans to ensure the safety of your password. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your current password. </p> <p>You may create more than one RuneScape account, but if you do, you may not log into more than one account at any time, and they must not interact with each other in any way. Using one account to drop objects for transfer to another of your accounts is not allowed. </p>
<p>You agree that your RuneScape character and account and items are and remain the property of Jagex. You may not sell, transfer or lend your account to anyone else, or permit anyone else to use your account, and you may not accept an account which anybody else offers you. </p> <p>We reserve the right to delete all your accounts, block your access to our website and services, and/or take further legal action if you violate any of these terms and conditions. We may delete or modify any account at any time for any reason. </p> 
<p> <b>Chat facility</b><br />When using the chat facility you must not use any language which may be considered by others to be offensive, racist or obscene, or otherwise infringes the rights of third parties. You must not use the chat facility to harass, threaten, scam or deceive other players. You agree that the chat facility is only for role-playing in the game, and is not designed or intended to be used as a forum for other types of discussion. You must not use the chat facility to advertise other websites or products. </p>
<p>You agree that for the purpose of preventing offensive language and cheating we may automatically or manually censor the chat as we see fit, and that we may record or monitor the chat to help us identify offenders. Sexually harassing, threatening, stalking or otherwise harassing others may result in legal action being taken against you.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of the sort of behaviour described above, or receive any other unwanted communications you must use the built in facilities to block the messages. If there is a particular user causing a problem then use the ignore function to block further messages (to do this in runescape-classic point at the friends menu, click on the 'ignore' tab, click where it says 'click here to add a name' and enter the name of the user to block. In the main runescape game, click on the 'Ignore List' button, click where it says 'Add Name' and enter the name of the user to block). If you continue to receive unwanted messages, or receive harassment from multiple players you must use the privacy controls to block all messages from everyone except your friends (to do this In runescape-classic point at the configuration menu, and ensure all four privacy settings are switched to 'on'. In the main runescape game there are three buttons below the game window marked 'Public chat', Private chat', and 'Trade/duel'. To block anyone other than your friends you will need to click the buttons until they display 'Friends'. To block everyone, including friends for complete privacy, click them until they display 'Off'.). If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied then you must stop using this web site. </p> 
<p><b>Cheating</b><br />Your use of RuneScape is also subject to our <a href="http://www.runescape.com/aff/runescape/guides/rules.html" class="c">Rules of Conduct</a>. You must not infringe these rules.</p>
 <p>You must not exploit any cheats or errors which you find in RuneScape. Any cheats or errors which you discover must be reported immediately to us (Jagex not James). </p> <p>You must not attempt to use other programs in conjunction with RuneScape to give yourself an unfair advantage. You may not use any bots or macros to control your character for you. You agree not to distribute such programs to other RuneScape players. When you are not playing you must logout. You may not circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to logout inactive users automatically. </p> <p>You must not misuse any of our customer service facilities. You must not deliberately enter false information into any of the forms on our website, or in RuneScape. You must not encourage, or attempt to trick other players into breaking our rules. </p> <p>RuneScape items may only be exchanged for other items/services within the game. You must not exchange RuneScape items, gold or in-game services for real-life money, real-life benefits, or benefits in other online games. You acknowledge that doing so would harm RuneScape, by allowing players to 'buy' their way to success, which spoils the experience for others and thus causes damage to us. You must not act as an intermediary to help others make infringing trades. You may not 'sell the time' you have invested in your account or items, since this falls under selling an in-game service. You may not offer RuneScape items or services as a free-gift which is given along with another purchase. </p>
<p>You must not reverse-engineer, decompile or modify the RuneScape client in any way. You must not use a modified/customised version of the RuneScape client. You must not create or provide any other means by which RuneScape may be played by others (including, without limitation, replacement or modified client/server software, server emulators). </p>
