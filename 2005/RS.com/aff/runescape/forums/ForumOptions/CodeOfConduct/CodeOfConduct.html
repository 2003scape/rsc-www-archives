 in the Spirit of RuneScape. The code of Conduct is easy to follow and 
should hold the answer to most of your Forum related questions.</p> <p>We
 urge all users to treat others as you would like to be treated and 
enjoy the wonderful community that is RuneScape. Let's work together to 
build and maintain an informative and friendly community!</p> <p>We hope you enjoy using our Forums.</p> <p>Many thanks from RuneScape Community Management.</p> <p class="highlight"><b>Warning:</b>

not acceptable.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="basic3"></a><p><b>Can I post the same thread in more than one forum?</b></p> <p>Do

multiple locations can be very frustrating, for users and moderators. 
Duplicate discussions will be deleted. Reposting the same message 
repeatedly can be interpreted as spam and could result in a permanent 
ban.</p> <p>However, if you make a post on a thread that exceeds the 
limit of 2,000 messages, you may create another thread in the same forum

 are players that have been hand-picked to represent Jagex, to assist us
 in providing a game that can be enjoyed by everyone. Their powers 
reside only in the Forums. They cannot help you with ban appeals, 
password recoveries, etc. You should contact customer support via the 
RuneScape website and you will receive the help you need.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="related3"></a><p><b>What is a sticky?</b></p> <p>Stickies
 are messages that will always stay at the top of the Forum. They 
contain information and clarification of rules that must be adhered to 
when using the Forums. Sometimes they can contain important information 
regarding world crashes in RuneScape or other important matters, so keep
 a look-out for when new stickies are added to the top of every Forum - 
they contain important information.</p> <p>Any other messages will always be displayed lower than a sticky.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="related4"></a><p><b>How do I ask for help?</b></p> <p>There is a thread in the General Forum entitled "Forum Emergencies" for this purpose.</p> <p>If
 you find a user has clearly violated either the Forum rules or the 
general rules as stated on our website, please post in this thread. If 
there is a player posting extreme amounts of spam, heavy flaming, 
obscene language or they are promoting a URL then you should also use 
this thread to notify the Forum Moderators. Please note that this thread
 is for incidents relating to the Forums <i>only</i>, and should not be used to post issues regarding the game.</p> <p>When posting in this thread please remember to include the following: </p><ul><li>The user causing the problem</li> <li>Forum</li> <li>Thread</li> <li>Page Number</li> </ul><p>Please only make one post per situation; rest assured that we shall work from this first post that you make.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="related5"></a><p><b>Why was my post removed?</b></p> <p>It
 is at the discretion of the Moderators if a thread or post should be 
deleted, so please don't make threads asking why such and such a thread 
was deleted.</p> <p>If a specific post of yours was edited or removed, 
it will have been because you have broken one of the main Forum 
guidelines here, or a Forum specific rule. We will notify you via the 
message centre in this case.</p> <p>If your post was simply in a thread 
that was removed you do not need to inquire about it. As mentioned above
 we will contact you if it was your post within the thread that was 
offensive.</p> <p>If you find that you have been warned, please re-read the rules to ensure this doesn't happen again.</p> <p>Please
 keep your posts clean and respectful. We do not accept flaming of any 
kind, joking around is fine, but being insulting for your own amusement 
will not be tolerated. We do not tolerate any kind of harassment.</p> <p>Debating is fine, insulting is not. Keep debates on-topic and do not insult any other user.</p> <p>Make
 sure the content you post is "tasteful". Remember we have males and 
females of broad age ranges, different religions, etc. Take some time to
 think about your post before hitting the Post button.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="related6"></a><p><b>Can I play the game and browse the Forums at the same time?</b></p> <p>It
 is totally permissable to play RuneScape and be in the RuneScape Forums
 at the same time, it will not be counted as a Multiple Login and no 
action will be taken against your account because of it.</p> <p>The only
 thing we would suggest is that you are careful about keeping an eye on 
your character whilst reading or posting to the Forums as monster 
attacks or random events can occur and your character may be killed 
because of it. As a general guide we would only advise you to be 
actively using both parts of our website when you are doing non-combat 
training and are in a 'safe' location.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="related7"></a><p><b>Help! I have no edit button to edit my posts in the Forums!</b></p> <p>If
 you cannot find the edit button in the Forum, first make sure that you 
are using the most recent version of your browser. Alternatively, please
 try using a different web browser to see if this works better for you. 
If this doesn't work, try using the official RuneScape client. Some 
users found that downgrading from Zone Alarm Pro to Zone Alarm helped. 
Alternatively, please make sure Zone Alarm Pro is set not to block 
anything from www.runescape.com.</p> <p>Please note Jagex cannot accept responsibility for any actions performed upon your PC by yourself. </p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="right"><a class="c" href="#top">Back to Top</a></td> </tr></tbody></table><center><br><br><a class="c" name="faq"></a><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="img/Faq_002_125x86.jpg"></td><td><h3>F.A.Q</h3></td> </tr></tbody></table></center><br><ul><li><a class="c" href="#faq1">Can I talk about another player?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq2">What is spam?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq3">Misleading titles - "Free Stuff"</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq4">Advertising other threads</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq5">Can I offer to help with any questions?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq6">My thread with no topic?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq7">Can I talk about hacks or scams?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq8">I want to make an apology or a thank you thread?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq9">I want to ask for stuff (begging)?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq10">Flaming a Player/Buyer/Seller</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq11">Can I ask about jobs?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq12">I'm leaving RuneScape - I want to make a farewell thread</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq13">I want to compliment specific Mods</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq14">"Freedom of Speech"</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq15">Trade Hijacking - I want to sell my item on someone else's thread?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq16">Threads that use the title "Official"</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq17">Stretching the Forum</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq18">"Do you know me?"</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq19">I want to draw on the Forums!</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq20">"Support the kitty"</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#faq21">Tickbox/Checkbox forms</a><br></li> </ul><a class="c" name="faq1"></a><p><b>Can I talk about another player?</b></p> <p>Please
 do not name other users in your posts. Everyone deserves their privacy.
 Claiming that the other user is your own character will not be allowed 
either. This includes the posting of bounties, as well as posting for 
other users.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq2"></a><p><b>What is spam?</b></p> <p>Please do not spam. Spam is a pointless message which wastes users' and Moderators' time. Think carefully about what you post.</p> <p>Do
 not encourage spam by posting further on a spammers thread. Instead 
just ignore the threads or posts. Please do not attempt to post further 
spam, or you too could end up with at least one warning. For example, a 
post on a spam thread such as 'locked' or 'corked' will not be tolerated
 and will also be considered as spam.</p> <p>Please avoid posting 
repetitive posts such as "Save The Kitty" or "Save The Bunny" as these 
to are considered spam. These are repeatedly pasted drawings in text 
(Ascii Grafitti). Please do not add them to your signatures or copy and 
paste into your posts.</p> <p>Some posts that are considered spam:</p> <ul><li>Posts that are off topic (If the topic was "How do I get to Falador" and you posted about Cheeseburgers, this would be spam).</li> <li>Posts that are just a jumble of Letters/symbols/numbers (an example: 98092;lkajskjkjalksd).</li> <li>Posts that have no value for discussion (making a thread that says "Bunnies are Fuzzy" is spam). </li><li>Posting 'THIS IS SPAM!' or anything like that on a topic.</li> <li>Making Duplicate Threads (making 3 threads/post that say "Where's Varrock"is spam).</li> </ul><p>Post
 Signatures are not to have over 2 lines of text. If a Forum Moderator 
deems that your signature could be classed as spam, they are allowed to 
ask users to remove the signature from further posts.</p> <p>Lastly, 
please do not repeatedly bump threads as it is also considered spam and 
could result in action being taken against your account.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq3"></a><p><b>Misleading titles - "Free Stuff"</b></p> <p>Misleading
 titles are not allowed. For example, you post a thread saying "Free 
Stuff" to just attract attention to your thread it is false advertising,
 and not permitted.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq4"></a><p><b>Advertising other threads</b></p> <p>Please
 do not do this as it can essentially be interpreted as spam and will 
not be tolerated. If you have an interesting topic then users will post 
on their own accord.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq5"></a><p><b>Can I offer to help with any questions?</b></p> <p>Threads
 that offer help not in any specific area are not allowed. They only 
encourage posting in the wrong Forum. Every question that can be 
answered has an appropriate Forum and can be answered there.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq6"></a><p><b>My thread with no topic?</b></p> <p>These will be removed in the interest of making threads shorter. It is also classed as spam. Please do not do this.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq7"></a><p><b>Can I talk about hacks or scams?</b></p> <p>Discussions about hacks, hacking or being hacked are against the Forums rules.</p> <p>Discussions
 of scams, scamming, or being scammed are not allowed on the Forums. Any
 of these discussions could both lead to complaints about being, either,
 hacked or scammed which is not allowed per Forum Code of Conduct. For 
further help with your account please do not hesitate to contact 
Customer Support.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq8"></a><p><b>I want to make an apology or a thank you thread?</b></p> <p>Please do not create these. They are just more spam for Moderators to clean up making it harder for mods to do their job.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq9"></a><p><b>I want to ask for stuff (begging)?</b></p> <p>Any form of begging on the Forums is not allowed, no matter the reason.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq10"></a><p><b>Flaming a Player/Buyer/Seller</b></p> <p>It
 is at the discretion of players to sell or buy items for the price they
 set. It is also at the discretion of players to not buy or sell items 
for prices previously set.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq11"></a><p><b>Can I ask about jobs?</b></p> <p>Threads
 asking for people to work together with on in-game quests, or offering 
your services in-game, are to be placed only in the Miscellaneous Forum.
 However, please note that requests for Quest Help (if you are stuck in a
 quest and don't know what to do) must go in the Quests forum, and are 
not allowed in Miscellaneous.</p> <p>The only exceptions to this rule 
are threads that fit under a more specific forum that can be 
appropriately posted there - for example, R/C runners in Runes, Miners 
in Ores and Bars, Log Cutting in Fletching, etc.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq12"></a><p><b>I'm leaving RuneScape - I want to make a farewell thread</b></p> <p>We cannot allow farewell threads as they often lead to flaming and begging.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq13"></a><p><b>I want to compliment specific Mods</b></p> <p>Singling
 out any Moderators for the good or bad is not allowed. We are a team

Please refrain from doing this.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq18"></a><p><b>"Do you know me?"</b></p> <p>Threads like these are not allowed.

 pictures or ASCII text-based pictures outside of the "Bored? Draw #ere"
 sticky in the Off-Topic Forum, are not allowed. The Forums are for 
discussions, not drawings. This includes drawings included in your 
signature. Please only post drawings in the designated thread. If not, 
these threads will be classed as spam and treated as such.</p> <p>The 
only exception to this rule is for drawings placed purely within Clan 
Forums. This includes Clan Logos, Business Logos and Logo Artist 
threads, which are to be placed only within the 'Clans Discussion' 
forums.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="faq20"></a><p><b>"Support the kitty"</b></p> <p>These

 you have been scammed/tricked out of items you should use the in game 
abuse report system to report the scammer. We can then take quick and 
immediate action. Please note that we do not return lost or stolen 
items.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="topic3"></a><p><b>I have been banned!</b></p> <p>Please
 do not post that you have been banned. If you have been temporarily or 
permanently banned you should not post about it on the Forums. Please 
use the correct procedure which is to send in a ban appeal through our 
customer support section on the RuneScape website.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="topic4"></a><p><b>Can I post rants?</b></p> <p>If
 you want to let off some steam or have a rant about an aspect of 
RuneScape, then do so in the Rants Forum. For example, even if you have a
 rant about a particular monster in the game its better suited in the 
rants Forum as opposed to the monster Forum.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="topic5"></a><p><b>Can I be a Moderator?</b></p> <p>Forum
 Moderators will be selected by Jagex staff only. Please do not ask 
about becoming a Moderator; requesting to be a Forum Moderator may 
reduce your chances of being chosen. The best way to be picked by one of
 our staff is to be a regular quality contributor to the Forums.</p> <p>Forum
 Moderators are normal players, not employees, who have been hand picked
 after they have managed to prove consistently that they have the skills
 and experience needed for helping us maintain fairness in the Forums.</p> <p>The
 best way to maximise your chances of being asked to become a Forum 
Moderator is to carry on posting in the Forums in accordance with the 
rules, and being helpful &amp; friendly to other players who are less 
experienced than yourself. We would also expect any future Forum 
Moderators to be able to express their opinions clearly.</p> <p>Keep doing this and the chances of you being selected for consideration as a Forum Moderator will be improved greatly.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="topic6"></a><p><b>I am looking for a Girlfriend/Boyfriend!</b></p> <p>Please
 do not consider these forums as a means for you to find one, by making 
posts asking for such information or something similar of this nature.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><a class="c" name="topic7"></a><p><b>Can I trade Forum signatures?</b></p> <p>Forum
 Signatures are not allowed to be traded for RuneScape items. This 
breaks Rule 12 and may result in an account being banned.</p> <p>Rule 12.</p> <p class="rule">RuneScape
 items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game. 
Exchanging RuneScape items for items or other benefits in other online 
games, real-life money or other real-life benefits is not allowed.</p> <p>The RuneScape rules are in place to ensure account security and fair play.</p> <p>Trading
 Forum Signatures is very dangerous for your account security and makes 
it very easy for hacking software such as keyloggers to be installed 
onto your computer.</p> <p>If you are unsure about the RuneScape rules 
or want more information on account security, relevant links (Read our 
rules &amp; Read our security tips) can be found under the Information 
and Advice section of <a class="c" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060421004247/http://www.runescape.com/" target="_blank">www.runescape.com</a>.</p> <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="right"><a class="c" href="#top">Back to Top</a></td> </tr></tbody></table><center><br><br><a class="c" name="ent_coms"></a><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="img/entertainment_communications_125x86.jpg"></td><td><h3>Entertainment / Communications</h3></td> </tr></tbody></table></center><ul><li><a class="c" href="#ent_coms1">Can I talk about other computer games?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#ent_coms2">Can I talk about using messenger services?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#ent_coms3">Can I talk about music?</a><br></li> <li><a class="c" href="#ent_coms4">Can I name my website or talk about other websites?</a><br></li> </ul><p><b>Can I talk about other computer games?</b></p> <p>If
 you want to discuss other games then please remember the following: any
 post about a game that is considered to be a competitive MMORPG will be
 removed. Posts about other genres are fine but regular Forum rules 
apply. There are to be no posts along the lines of, Game X is better 
than RuneScape.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><p><b>Can I talk about using messenger services?</b></p> <p>Bringing
 attention to Instant Messaging services is not allowed. Giving out any 
personal information, contact details, emails, or usernames is strictly 
forbidden. Posts referring to and giving out this form of information 
will be removed.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><p><b>Can I talk about music?</b></p> <p>If
 you want to discuss your tastes in music in the Off-Topic Forums, then 
please remember the following: any thread that descends into a flame war
 will have to be removed.</p> <p>Please remember to read the Off-Topic Forum rules. Each forum has its own rules highlighted in green, at the top of each forum.</p> <center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><p><b>Can I name my website or talk about other websites?</b></p> <p>As
 most players will know, there are some websites out there that steal 
player's passwords which will spoil their enjoyment of the game. We take
 password security very seriously and have to enforce a rule whereby no 
websites are advertised on the Forum to protect our users. Do not post 
any web addresses in the Forums.</p> <p>It is a breach of the rules to post anything promoting a website in the Forums or in the game. <b>This includes talking about clan websites.</b> As such if you do post up the URL for your clan site you could get banned. </p><p>We
 understand this will cause you inconvenience but please remember that 
this rule is there to make it impossible for people to send players to 
scam sites.</p> <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="right"><a class="c" href="#top">Back to Top</a></td> </tr></tbody></table><center><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><img src="img/smstones.jpg"><img src="img/smstones.jpg"></center><center><h3>Thank you for reading our Code of Conduct. <br>For more information please go to <a href="../../../guides/guides.html" class="c">the rules & security index</a></h3>
