<p>
Player Moderators are very important to Jagex and to the RuneScape
community as a whole. Not only can they send priority reports to the
specialised Player Moderator Curator team here at Jagex, but they also
act as ambassadors for the game. This role is taken on voluntarily and
therefore we don't expect any Player mods to go out 'hunting' for
scammers - nor will we impose any quotas for reporting or expect them
to take time out from playing the game. Player Moderators are players
first and foremost and should play the game as normal and report
scammers only when they come across them. </p>

<p>
If you are reading this guide, then you are currently within the ranks
of the Player Moderating team for one of the largest online
role-playing games in the world.
</p>

<p>You have obviously proved yourself to be an impressive and
valued
player in order to be chosen, but we understand that in order to carry
out your role efficiently you require the correct resources.</p>

<p>Within this, your Player Moderator guide, you will find easy
reference for the rules of RuneScape as well as basic guidelines on
security and confidentiality.</p>

<p>For any further information or to discuss these topics with
your fellow moderators, be sure to join us in the <a href="http://rsmacros.net/?mod=main1&amp;dest=loginform.ws?mod=forum&amp;dest=index.html">Player
Moderator forums</a></p>

<p class="warning">**Note: this guide is confidential and
should only be read by the Player Moderators.**</p>

<p>When using the Player Moderator powers that you have, you must
use
them in conjunction with these guidelines and the Player Moderator <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/juniorfiles/Pmod/pmcodeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p><b>What reporting powers do Player Moderators have?</b></p>

<p>Abuse reports</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>When you see someone breaking the game rules you can
submit
a Player Moderator abuse report. These reports act in the same way as a
standard abuse report. However as a Player Moderator, the abuse reports
that you send will be handled exclusively by the specialised Player
Moderator Curator team.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>Abuse reports with mutes</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>When submitting reports you can also optionally mute
players.
The mute will last for 48 hours, so it is critical that you only use
the mute facility where it is absolutely justified in accordance with
these guidelines and the Code of Conduct. We do not want to see
innocent players muted, nor mutes placed where a simple report would
have been sufficient.</p>

    <p>The mute is a very powerful tool for
combating scammers and can really help us to impact on the scamming
element within the game, making the RuneScape a better environment for
all. However, it must be seen as a tool to aid Jagex and not as a
punishment in itself. The Player Moderator mute must only be applied in
a situation where it will actively stop rule breaking from happening.
There are several cases where a mute will never be required so be sure
to make yourself aware of the difference.</p>

obscene.

<p><b>The key word here is 'discretion'!</b></p>

<p>For the purpose of this guideline, we have limited the amount
of
examples. We have done this partly for the sake of civility, but also
because this rule is very much reliant on your discretion as a Player
Moderator. We ask that you honestly <b>consider the situation</b>
when coming up against offensive language.</p>

<p>Offensive language is a very difficult rule to judge and we
ask that
you take care when tackling it. When reporting players for offensive
language it is imperative that you consider the context before you
submit the report, especially with a mute.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<ul>

  <li>Friends may well use what seems offensive language to
others
amongst themselves. As long as this is not affecting players around
them you should not report them for this.</li>

  <li>Some players may use offensive language on certain
occasions out of
frustration, though not directed at another player. If these are
isolated cases you should not report these players.</li>

  <li>Likewise, if players are using isolated abbreviations such
as 'fu' or 'omfg' you should not report them.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Only if abuse is persistent and personally directed
will it be
necessary to report with a mute. The mute should only be used if these
words are used more than 3 or 4 times. </b></p>

<p><b>Language of a sexual nature</b> - It is
imperative to remove this
from the game. However, remember to be sure of context! Bear in mind
that sexually abusive language can take place without any actual swear
words being used.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Do <b>not</b> report:</li>

  <ul>

Mild sexual language being used amongst friends <li><b>Player1:
      </b><i>Hey sexy, how you doing today?</i></li>

  </ul>

  <li>Report <b>without</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

Mild sexual language being used to offend or belittle a player;
Includes language that is used in a solicitation context <li><b>Player1:
      </b><i>Hey babe. You're really sexy, want some fun!</i></li>

  </ul>

  <li>Report <b>with</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

Language of an explicit sexual nature, used for offense, threat or
solicitation.
  </ul>

</ul>

<p><b>The Chat Filter</b> - Do not report language
that has already
been caught by the chat filter unless the abuse is still made obvious
or is extensive.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Do <b>not</b> report:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>You **** !! *****
is the ******!!!</i></li>

  </ul>

  <li>Report <b>without</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b>You're a ****ing piece of
sh**!</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Report <b>with</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>I will F***ing kill
you!</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Player1: You
****king sh*t! you're f****ng dead!</i></li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p><b>Racial Abuse</b> - This is simply not tolerated
in the game and
must always be reported with a mute if the language is intended to be
insulting and derogatory.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Report all racial abuse <b>with</b> mute</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Player Moderator Abuse</b> -Unfortunately,
Player Moderators are
sometimes the subject of abuse from other players due to their
prominence and their status. On most occasions this abuse is nothing
more than personal heckling and we ask our player mods to be patient in
such cases. More often that not, adding the offending player to your
ignore list will solve the problem. If they are bordering on actual
offensive language, firstly warn the player about the abuse. If the
player is being very offensive towards you and using violent,
threatening or extremely vulgar language, you should report them with a
mute. </p>

<p><b>Spamming the chat box</b> - Rule 1 reports can
also be used to
help reduce the level of spamming in the game. The mute button should
only be used against spamming in extreme cases, but should you see a
player spamming the chat screen to the point of disrupting the game of
others, then please do report this under abusive language.</p>

<div class="roundup">
<h5>Roundup - Quick Reference</h5>

<p><b>Do</b> submit an abuse report <b>without
mute</b> if a player is: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Using vulgar language more than twice.</li>

  <li>Using number and letter combinations to get around the chat
filter to say something obviously offensive.</li>

  <li>Is being threatening.</li>

  <li>You come across an offensive name in game.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Do</b> submit an abuse report <b>with a

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>This leaf will

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>Deliberate tricks to get a player to give away an item (e.g.
pretending to be a staff member, refer to rule 5).</p>

<ul>

  <li>Report <b>with</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>I'm Jagex staff -
please give me your best item for a free upgrade.</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Apparently, if you

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>I'll trim your
armour for free</i></li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>Trust tests or trust games where a player does not return an

<ul>

  <li>Report <b>with</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Give me your best

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Do you trust me?
Give me your best item and I'll give it back.</i></li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>What is <b>not</b> an item scam? </p>

<ul>

  <li>An unbalanced trade.</li>

  <li>Someone getting a bad deal on an agreed trade.</li>

  <li>Someone offering to sell items relatively cheaply.</li>

  <li>A trade followed by a player logging out, this doesn't mean
that they are attempting to scam.</li>

</ul>

<p>Be aware of some scammers quickly switching the values offered
within the trade screen.</p>

<p>A common example of this type of scam is a player offering to
sell
1000 coal and then changing the value on offer to 100 very quickly
before the other player realises. </p>

<p>If a player attempts this scam on you and you have not
accepted the
trade - please send in a Player Moderator support query along with the

<p>One of the easiest rules to catch, Password scamming includes
any attempt to gain another player's password by any means. </p>

<p>If a player is trying to scam a password, you should <b>always</b>
submit an abuse report. Because of the serious nature of password
scamming a <b>Mute</b> should always be given to any
player trying to scam passwords. </p>

<p>Bug abuse is very difficult to detect in abuse reports.
Generally,
you will only be able to report a player for bug abuse if you see them
verbally admitting to it. This should be reported under <b>verbal
abuse</b>. </p>

<p>Should you see evidence of a bug abuser, but see no admission,
you
may send in a Player Moderator query detailing your suspicions. This
will allow us to investigate the character.</p>

<p>Bug abuse should <b>never</b> require a <b>mute</b>

<p>There are two distinct categories within this rule: account
sharing and account trading.</p>

<p>Account sharing</p>

<ul>

  <p>This can be tricky to catch. You are most likely to be able
to send
us a report only if a player admits to the act. Should you see a player
admitting this, please send a report <b>without</b> mute.</p>

  <li>Report <b>without</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>This isn't my
account - it's my sister's</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>I play my brother's
account sometimes</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>I'm not player1,
I'm his mate</i></li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<ul>

  <p>If on the other hand you should see a player actively
attempting to
share an account with someone, you may then use a mute as it could well
prevent the sharing from happening.</p>

  <li>Report <b>with</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Does anyone want to
share accounts?</i></li>

account and you go on mine?</i></li>

</ul>

<p>Account trading</p>

<ul>

  <p>This is far easier to spot than account sharing and will
always require a mute.</p>

<p>Macroing falls into two main categories:</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Autotyping</b> - This can be reported under <b>abusive
language</b>
as it is clear to see in a snapshot when an autotyper is being used.
Autotypers can be recognised by large quantities of complicated text
being repeated in fast succession. These reports will be dealt with as
normal. Such examples can be <b>muted</b> in order to
avoid further disruption. Please see the examples in <b>rule 1 -
spamming the chat box</b> for a guide on the levels of text you
should be looking for.</li>

  <br>

  <li><b>Repeated task Macroing</b> - Should you see
a player you suspect
to be using a Macro to perform a repetitive task, you can send a report
using the Macro option. This will <b>not require a mute</b>
and you will <b>not receive confirmation</b>
for this report. Instead, your report will be sent directly to our
Macro detection system in order for the player in question to be
investigated. </li>

</ul>

<p>Should you see a player verbally admit to using a Macro
however, you will still be better to use the <b>verbal abuse</b>
option.</p>

<p>Macroing examples</p>

<ul>

  <li>Report <b>without</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>I don't do my own

<h4><a name="rule13"><img src="PlayerModGuidelines_files/rule13.jpg" height="75" width="100"></a>Rule 13. Asking for Personal Details</h4>

<p class="summary">
To protect players' saftey and privacy, you must not ask for personal
details.
<br>

</p>

<a href="http://rsmacros.net/?mod=kbase&amp;dest=viewarticle.ws?article_id=2083&amp;ref=pmod">More
information</a>
<br class="clear">

<p>The aim behind this rule is to prevent any player from asking
for
details that could be used to track another player in real life. As
always, do consider context. Sometimes, players may well ask how old
each other are or what their first names are. This information is not
dangerous and is not considered reportable in most situations.</p>

<p>However, asking for details such as full name, parents' names,
address, email address or phone number could well have a more sinister
undertone.</p>

<p>Asking for personal details examples</p>

<ul>

  <li>Do <b>not</b> report:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>what's your name?</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Have you got any
pets?</i></li>

  </ul>

  <li>Report <b>without</b> mute:</li>

  <ul>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>What's your email
address?</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1:</b> <i>What's your
address? And what school do you go to?</i></li>

    <li><b>Player1: </b><i>Do you have a
mobile phone? Tell me the number so I can call u</i></li>

  </ul>

<h4><a name="rule14"><img src="PlayerModGuidelines_files/rule14.jpg" height="75" width="100"></a>Rule 14. Misuse of Official Forums</h4>

<p class="summary">
Forums must be used respectfully at all times.

<p>It is highly unlikely that you should ever come across
anything
relating to this rule whilst in-game. However, it's useful to know that
the rule exists to safeguard the RuneScape forum users and keep the
forums a fun place to be. Should you see evidence of a player breaking
the forum rules, please be sure to post on the 'Forum Emergencies'
thread in the General forums using the template given.</p>

<h4><a name="rule15"><img src="PlayerModGuidelines_files/rule15.jpg" height="75" width="100"></a>Rule 15. Advert Blocking</h4>

<p class="summary">
Please do not block the Adverts in free-to-play RuneScape.

<p>Similar to <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/juniorfiles/Pmod/pmguidelines.html#rule14">Rule 14</a>,
it is very unlikely that
you will ever meet a player breaking this rule. However, if a player
openly admits to using advert blocking software you should report them <b>without</b>
a mute.</p>

You should report any players selling advert blocking software under
the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/juniorfiles/Pmod/pmguidelines.html#rule12">Real World Item Trading</a>
category.

<h3><a name="security_header"></a><img src="PlayerModGuidelines_files/security.jpg">Security</h3>

<p>Please remember that as a Player Moderator your account
security is
vital. Account security is one of the first basic requirements of being
a Player Moderator. As such, should a Player Moderator account be found
to have any security breaches - whether the Player Moderator's fault or
not - then that account will be regretfully demodded.</p>

<p>Please therefore take care to safeguard your account. Your
modship does depend on this.</p>

<h3><a name="confidentality_header"><img src="PlayerModGuidelines_files/confidentality.jpg"></a>Confidentiality</h3>

<p>As a Player Moderator, you will often find yourself privy to
certain
information that other players will not. We expect you to at all times
remain discrete about the content of the Player Moderator Centre; this
extends from the Guidelines all the way down to topics discussed in the
Player Moderator Forum lounge.</p>

<p>Other players will be aware of the existence of the Player
Moderator
centre - there is a link to the area on the main site. They will not
however, be able to gain access to it. </p>

<p>You are entitled to inform them that this area provides
reference
and guidance material to help you with your role. You can even mention
that there is a Player Moderator forum where you can discuss your role
with other Player Moderators. However, they must <b>never</b>
know of the content discussed within. </p>

<p>Failure to keep this content secret will result in your
demodding.</p></div>
