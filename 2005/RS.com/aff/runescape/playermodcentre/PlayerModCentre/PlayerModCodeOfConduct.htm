<p ccid="3086">Jagex entrust Player moderators to use their sound judgement,

the guidance of Jagex staff to take the appropriate action against
players breaking our rules. To best manage the role it is vital that

<p ccid="4151">
</p>

<p ccid="4164">As a player moderator you must be security conscious.</p>

<p ccid="4228">You must never:</p>

<p ccid="4254">
</p>

<ul ccid="4267">

  <li ccid="4277">Share your account with anyone else</li>

  <li ccid="4392">Use any modified client to play Runescape</li>

  <li ccid="4448">Visit any websites that offer Runescape cheats or hacks
(These are
a very big security risk and many will attempt to install viruses on
your computer or to harvest your password)</li>

free from hacks please read our <a ccid="4748" href="http://rsmacros.net/?mod=kbase&amp;dest=viewarticle.ws?ref=pmod&amp;article_id=2087" class="c">security tips</a></p>

<p ccid="4869"><b ccid="4872">Using player moderator powers</b></p>

<p ccid="4916">As player moderators, you have the ability to mute players for
48
hours that are breaking the rules. Muting a player must only be done in
accordance with the Player moderator guidelines.</p>

<p ccid="5116">Always refer to the <a ccid="5139" href="http://www.freewebs.com/juniorfiles/Pmod/pmguidelines.html" class="c">player moderator guidelines</a> for the
correct way to use the moderator powers that have been entrusted to you.</p>

<p ccid="5339">By accepting our offer to become a player moderator you are
agreeing
to only use the moderator controls you have in the proper manner.</p>

<p ccid="5486"><b ccid="5489">In game behaviour</b></p>

<p ccid="5521">Player moderators are in a privileged role, you are
ambassadors of the game.</p>

<p ccid="5609">When in game always abide by the rules yourself, you should
always
lead by example. You should go about playing Runescape in the most
helpful way possible.</p>

<p ccid="5778"><b ccid="5781"><i ccid="5784">Interacting with other players</i></b></p>

<p ccid="5833">Treat other players as you would expect to be treated, respect
is the key to successfully being a Player moderator.</p>

<p ccid="5960">Always keep your chat with other players polite and
respectful. Remember people will follow your example.</p>

<p ccid="6077">Obviously
you will still go about playing the game in the normal way, however
when trading, duelling or doing other in game actions you should always
do so in an honest and respectful way. Doing so and setting the
standards will encourage everyone to play in this way and the result
will be an even better place to play.</p>

<p ccid="6413"><b ccid="6416"><i ccid="6419">How to respond to questions from other
players</i></b></p>

<p ccid="6485">Other players will inevitably ask you questions about being a
player
moderator. This can sometimes be challenging, especially when you are
in the middle of a quest or fighting a monster, but remember that
people will be interested. You do not need to respond to every question
but be courteous where you can.</p>

<p ccid="6809">Never respond to players questions with rude or impatient
answers.
It is much better simply to put chat blocks on if you are being
disturbed than to answer someone in a rudely.</p>

<p ccid="6999">Never threaten anyone asking you questions with action against
them. Where you see rule breaking (As defined in the <a ccid="7119" href="http://www.freewebs.com/juniorfiles/Pmod/pmguidelines.html" class="c">Player Moderator
Guidelines</a> in the Player Moderator Centre) take action but
only where it is right to do so.</p>

<p ccid="7320"><b ccid="7323"><i ccid="7326">How to respond to rule breaking reports from
other players</i></b></p>

<p ccid="7404">As a Player moderator, you should report and sometimes mute
players
when you see them breaking the rules. This does not mean that you must
follow up every report that other players send you. You should carry on
playing as you always have.</p>

<p ccid="7657">If someone private messages you to tell you someone is rule
breaking
you do not have to investigate. You should however be polite in
answering the player that took time to tell you. They are after all
acting in the best interests of the game. If you do not want to
investigate then you should tell the player that they should submit an
abuse report for the Customer Support team to investigate.</p>

<p ccid="8068"><b ccid="8071">Using the forums</b></p>

<p ccid="8102">All conversations relating to the Player moderator role should
be
done in the Player Moderator forum section. This is a special forum,
visible only to Player moderators and Jagex staff.</p>

<p ccid="8301">Do not discuss player moderator business in the other forums.
The
information in the player moderator specific forums is confidential and
should not be shared.</p>

<p ccid="8474">The player moderator forum is specifically for player
moderator
business. If you want to discuss general issues please use the other
forum threads available.</p>

<p ccid="8645"><b ccid="8648">Wider community</b></p>

<p ccid="8678">As stated above, any information related to being a player
moderator
is confidential. Player moderator business must not be discussed on the
forums of other websites.</p>

<p ccid="8858">Players will discuss player moderators on other websites, it
is
essential that you do not offer answers to these forums. Remember,
information about player moderators is confidential.</p>
