<b>What personal information is collected?</b>
</p>
<p>
The only personal information we collect about you is information which you provide yourself via forms on our website, or our billing partners websites. (e.g. when you register with us, contact customer support, or sign up for membership).
</p>
<p>
No personal information is collected when you access the public areas of our website.
</p>
<p>
No personal information is collected when you play our Single Player Games.
</p>
<p>
To play our Multiplayer games you will need to choose a username and password and provide a valid email address.

<p>
To subscribe for RuneScape membership you will also need to provide contact information including: your name, a valid email address, gender, home address, phone/fax number, zip/postal code, and country, together with payment details (such as credit card number and expiry date).
</p>
<p>
To make use of our customer support service you will need to provide an email address and information relating to your query. To enable us to provide a better customer support service we may also ask you provide contact information including: your name, email, postcode and country, and to provide a number of security questions which we can use to verify your identity if you require assistance in the future. The questions and the answers you provide are up to you. You may opt-out of providing some of this information but it will limit the effectiveness of our support service if you do. We also sometimes collect and store other information by way of a questionnaire to assist our advertisers and partners.
</p>
<p>
You may opt-out of providing any information by simply choosing not to complete the form requesting the information, and hence choosing not to use that particular service.
