<u></u></p><h3><u>Saga of the Antihero - by Gen Crunchy</u></h3>

<p align="justify">

<p align="justify">his story tells the tale of the antihero, the person who got it all... nearly.
Now let us silence, and hear the saga of the antihero...</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p align="justify">
Suddenly there was a light, and, after his eyes had adjusted to that 
strange new sensation, a town appeared before him, a town dominated by a
 grand castle, with a few little buildings hidden in the castle's 
shadow.<br>
Disoriented, our antihero looked at a sign, saying "Lumbridge general 
store". As his mind raced to grasp what had happened, a text in the 
corner of his eye grabbed his attention, it stated "welcome to 
Runescape".</p><p align="justify">
Runescape, could this be the name of that strange new world? but how did
 he get here? would this be life, about which he knew so much? but how 
did he knew? he couldn't remember anything before that light...<br>
He woke out of his pondering when someone called to him, "hey noob, move
 it". Puzzled he stepped aside for a knight, or so it appeared, in 
sparkling, sky-blue armour, a grand shining sword dangling at his side. 
As the knight passed, a rich purple cloak was revealed, dancing on the 
lively steps of the knight.<br> 
With this image still burning on his retina, our antihero thought: 
"that's what I want to be". And so he set out on his quest to seek the 
reason of his existence, indeed, his birthright in that grand new world,
 Runescape.
</p><p align="justify">
<u></u></p><h4><u>First Steps</u></h4>
<p align="justify">
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<img src="../../../../../img/varrock/elaborate/elaboratet.gif" align="top" height="100" width="100"></td><td>
he antihero's first steps were towards that grand castle, surely he could find a helping hand there.<br>
He had been right, the first person he spoke to turned out to be the 
governor, and he was as helpful as to tell him that mining and smithing 
were quick and easy ways to earn some hard needed coin. So it came that 
our antihero took his trusty pick, of which only Saradomin knows how it 
had gotten in his pocket, and set out to crush some rock.</td></tr></tbody></table>
This was the time that rocks were still hard, and obtaining ore still 
took several hits. but after a long and rewarding day of work, he 
carried a small collection of self-made daggers and hatchets, wrought 
with blood, sweat and tears. The local arms dealer of Varrock was so 
kind as to pay a good price for these daggers, and our antihero found 
himself in possession of his first gold coins! Of course these coins 
were savoured, and safely stored in the reliable safes of the Bank of 
Varrock. 
</p><p align="justify">
More of these days followed, and our antihero became more proficient. He
 soon crafted more and more of his equipment until one day he laid down 
his hammer, sighed in relief, and tried on his masterpiece: bronze 
plate. Our antihero now walked around in what is called "full bronze".<br>
Our antihero was then eager to try out the fruit of his labours, and 
sought an appropriate opponent. 
The battle against the evil rats populating the sewers was hard, but in 
the end our antihero emerged, hands shed in rat blood, armour dented on 
al sides, his own blood dripping from a nasty gap in his forehead, but 
wiser, stronger and more experienced.
On that day, our antihero had set his first steps on the path that would
 lead him further than he had dared dream. A path of hard work, of 
complex mysteries, grand battles, but most of all, well earned 
experience.
</p><p align="justify">
<u></u></p><h4><u>Growing and Integrating</u></h4>
<p align="justify">
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<img src="../../../../../img/varrock/elaborate/elaborateo.gif" align="top" height="100" width="100"></td><td>ur
 hero kept growing more experienced, in crafting armour and weapons, in 
slaying the doers of evil, and even in the fine arts of the kitchen, for
 it gave him great delight to sit down after a harsh battle and enjoy a 
good meal.</td></tr></tbody></table>
This advancing of our antihero was noticed by other people, who sought 
his help, and rewarded him greatly every time he slew an evildoer, 
retrieved a prized artefact, or just did the groceries. Through this, 
slowly but surely his reputation grew and grew, and our antihero found 
himself being in possession of the one thing harsh labour or coins can't
 get you: friends. Some of these friends were already far more 
experienced than he was, and our antihero learned a great deal from 
those friends, knowledge he was happy to share with his less experienced
 friends, or just the random passer-by in need of help.</p><p align="justify">
As our antihero advanced through trying, talking and training, he joined
 several guilds, the cook's guild, where he learned even more of the 
fine kitchen, the mining guild, as he was capable in unearthing the ores
 that mother nature hid so well, the crafting guild, for his fingers 
ware adapt at cutting gems, the holy church of Saradomin, for our 
antihero was a devoted worshipper, and even the champions guild, for 
doing his fair share in making Runescape a better place.<br>
He was also more appreciated by his growing number of friends, helping 
out those in need, or just being a good friend, a listening ear and a 
giver of advice.<br>
Thus all went well, until in the end, one obstacle stood between our 
antihero and his vision of the knight in blue: the dragon of Crandor 
Isle.
</p><p align="justify">
<u></u></p><h4><u>The Dragon of Crandor Isle</u></h4>
<p align="justify">
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<img src="../../../../../img/varrock/elaborate/elaborateo.gif" align="top" height="100" width="100"></td><td>ur
 antihero had grown, learned and had made friends, but still, he had not
 reached his goal: that prestigious blue armour called full rune. only 
one obstacle remained between him and that goal: the dragon of Crandor 
Isle.<br>
Our antihero took up the quest to overcome this obstacle, to defeat the 
dragon, so to reach his ultimate goal and to rid the world of this great
 evil.</td></tr></tbody></table>
His friend the Governor of Lumbridge gave him the "anti-dragon breath 
shield" to help our friend come back in one piece, the champion's guild 
provided the best equipment they could for this great undertaking, the 
cook's guild chef personally prepared a good supply of nourishing fish 
to go, the crafting guild made the best amulet they could, the assembled
 monks of Saradomin prayed for success, the mining guild even threw in 
some extra strength training. All this resulted in our antihero being as
 ready as he would ever be.<br>
So it was that our antihero boarded his ship, the "Lumbridge Lady" and 
set sail to Crandor Isle. Captain Ned guided the ship well, not even a 
freak storm, which nearly sank them, could stop Captain Ned from 
reaching Crandor Isle. however, the fair Lumbridge Lady was to beaten up
 to sail back home, so the only way out was in,
into the dank lair that was home to that evil creature, the Dragon.<br>
After killing many evil creatures guarding their master of evil, our 
antihero reached the dragon's lair, a few people there wished him luck, 
and our antihero entered that dank lair.<br>
He saw the dragon, uttered a last prayer to Saradomin and fearlessly 
charged it, only to find a bloodstained, black, scarred dragonclaw 
ripping through his intestines, and all went black...<br>
Suddenly there was a light, and, after his eyes had adjusted to that 
strange new sensation, a town appeared before him, a town dominated by a
 grand castle...<br>
