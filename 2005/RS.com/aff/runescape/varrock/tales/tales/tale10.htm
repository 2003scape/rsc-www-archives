any ages ago, a group of thieves built a ship called
the 'Raider'. This group of thieves was
known as the Terminy Ring. The Terminy Ring sailed
around Runescape from town to town on the
Raider, terrorizing citizens and breaking into houses
with their trusty lock picks.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p align="justify">
After a few good
years of thieving and terrorizing, the Terminy Ring
had quite a profitable stockpile of loot,
which included caskets full of gold, gemstones, and
jewelry, along with gloves and boots 
(gear which every member of the Terminy Ring was
required to wear). </p><p align="justify">
One day a group of angry 
citizens who had been robbed by the Terminy Ring
decided they would get revenge. So the citizens put
their savings together and built their own seaworthy
ship, which they called the Destroyer. <br>
The Destroyer
was much faster and had much more firepower than the
Raider. One night the Destroyer took
a test run and a citizen reported seeing a ship from
the crow's nest.  Upon getting closer 
they saw the ship was the Raider. The Destroyer opened
fire on the Raider and the Raider 
exploded! Boots, gloves, and caskets flew everywhere.
</p><p align="justify">
<table><tbody><tr><td>

ne citizen's journal read: "Tonight we
came in contact with those yellow bellies who stole
our gold. We destroyed their ship and
everyone aboard it. The ship had exploded; boots,
gloves, and caskets fell from the
sky. It was almost like the sky was raining items!
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p align="justify">
There was so much loot aboard the Raider
that it took an hour just for all the items to plunge
into the ocean." Even today fishermen 
report finding boots, gloves, and caskets in their
catches. Some even say that on foggy
nights, with a full moon in the sky, you can see a
ghostly silhouette of the Raider sailing on the sea.
</p><p align="justify">
And if you listen carefully, you can hear the screams
of the victims that were terrorized long ago.
