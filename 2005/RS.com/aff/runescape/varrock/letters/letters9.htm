</p><p align="justify"> Hail, all ye followers of darkness! Cower in terror,
all seekers of light. Everyone else can just listen.
That self-righteous brother of mine has been hogging the
stage for far too long, especially when Runescape
players know who holds the real power around here- me! </p><p align="justify">
So I've stolen Saradomin's mailbag and thrown all
his letters on the floor. I had to pick them up again in
order to read them, but I think I made my point.
<br>
Some of them were quite good actually- even if most
represented the sort of pathetic whining that I would
expect from followers of Saradomin. </p><p></p><p align="justify"> For example:<br>
<i></i></p><p align="justify"><i> <font color="white"> </font></i></p><p><i><font color="white">
Dear Saradomin
</font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white"> Us Runescape Veterans are so under-rated. I've
been called a noob, yet I've been here since the
beginning, and yet when someone asks, when Runescape
came out, everyone insists 2000. Yet as soon as I say
'98, it's a big laugh. Though in your newsletter, you
stated, "Five Ages after creating the world of
Runescape, the great god Saradomin now regularly
communicates with the inhabitants of this fast
evolving planet." Does that prove that Runescape came
out in '98? </font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white"> Wizarding2
</font></i>
</p><p align="justify">
Clearly not. And if you were truly a "veteran", you would know when 
Runescape was created. Your friends are right to laugh at you. </p><p align="justify">
 But at the same time, you were obviously trying to intimidate others 
with your pretence of superior knowledge, and for this you deserve some 
credit. </p><p align="justify">
In other letters and prayers, Toxy55 asks <i> "where
skeletons come from". </i> My advice would be to head down to
the wilderness and find out. As Guthix would say, the
answers are inside of you.
</p><p align="justify">
Ah, how I love the wildy. That place where death and
deceit go hand in hand. </p><p align="justify"> For some, this is a problem. Jacob9ruler complains that <i> "it is hard to find someone who doesn't deceive another person in the wilderness, to gain something like an item". </i>
</p><p>
</p><p align="center"><img src="letters9_files/knight-under-attack.jpg" height="190" width="285"> <font color="white"></font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white">
</font></p><p><font color="white"><i>"I found that around 35% of
the people I 'Team' with actually end up killing me." </i>
</font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white">
This is what I like to hear! So be warned all naive
and foolish types: conducting surveys on the
trustworthiness of your friends can leave you vulnerable
to attack. But the final word must go to Kenny22, on the subject of
Christmas hats. </font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white"> <i>"I, personally, woke up at 4am eastern standard time to get the hats." </i> (applause). </font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white"> He then complains about the fact that his friend logged
on at 12pm and was also able to find hats.</font></p><font color="white">
<p align="justify">
As god of chaos and evil, I naturally assumed that I was the expert at 
bringing misery into people's lives. But you, Kenny22, show a level of 
stinginess that surpasses all other Kennys, a meanness of heart that I 
thought was unattainable in mere mortals.
</p><p align="justify"> Feeling suitably inspired, I must now go and bring some
more chaos and destruction to the universe. To all those who have been waiting patiently for me, our
moment is nigh!
</p><p align="justify">
Strength through chaos-
