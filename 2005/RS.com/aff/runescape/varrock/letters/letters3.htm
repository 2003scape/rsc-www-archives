A warm welcome to one and all,
</p><p align="justify">
And so it is that time again when I respond to your many
questions regarding this wonderful land of ours. The good god of
Runescape has been feeling a bit under the weather this week, so
I'll cut to the chase.

Greetings great Saradomin. I am a great worshipper amongst you.
You have made this world beautiful and as great as can be.
However, there are many people that do not follow your religion.
This is due to the large lack of people who bury bones. The world
of Runescape needs a new bone, that will draw them ever closer to
your spirituality. The solution to this, is dragon bones. As you
know, dragons are the most grand of all foes in Runescape. Few
warriors are able to slay these beasts of almighty power. But
those who do should be especially awarded with dragon bones. With
dragon bones your number of worshippers will increase beyond
believe! And the evil powers of your brother Zamorak shall not
stand a chance against the holy spiritual powers on the plane of
Runescape. Please Saradomin, the fate of Runescape can not fall
into Zamorak's hands.

</p><p align="justify">
Hmm... Zamorak's not that bad you know - actually he's worse! But
he is still my brother, even if he can't be bothered to keep in
touch these days. I do agree about the bones though. This was a
popular request, and I can tell you that they should be
available within the next week! So consider your prayers
answered, and get on down to your nearest dragon.
</p><p>

Dear Saradomin,
</font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
After hitting big bars of metal all day with my trusty hammer, i
suddenly thought: "I wish i could wack someone over the head with
this". Then an idea came to me. Why not create mighty war-hammers
to blight thy enemies with. Higher power than axes and even less
aim....wow. The different metals could all be used to make them
and I think they would be a welcome new weapon to all us rune
-scapers out there on the battlefields. Your faithfull warrior,

<p align="justify"> Well it's good to see such enthusiasm for one's 
work. But I'm afraid that your desires are not aligned with the greater 
scheme of things- we're trying to expand people into 3D, whilst you're 
trying to flatten them out! But certainly you have been successful in 
lodging your words into my brain, so maybe in the far distant future...
</p><p>
And so onto that most controversial of subjects - money.
It appears that begging is still something of a problem in the world
of Runescape, with many a hard-working player still being plagued
by requests for free stuff. Fortunately there are a few truly
civic minded young persons who believe in the concept of paying
people for all their hard-work.</p></font></td><td>

One individual even asked me how it feels to be "the first god
that requires money to sustain your world." This confused me
somewhat, as to my knowledge, Runescape is one of the largest
free-worlds of its' kind, with at least one hundred hours of free
quests and things to do.
</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
I've received a few notes from Runescapers who "feel
left out" of the members game and wish they could access the new 
features. The answer to is of course... ..become a member! To quote a 
certain fellow from the Council of Runescape...
</p><p align="justify">
<i><font color="white">
We currently need to concentrate on continued development for the
membership servers as membership subscriptions pays for all
support services (for free players as well), the running costs of
all the machines(including free servers), staff wages (who help
support free servers) and the development costs of new quests,
skills and future technology.
</font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
Please remember that the game was free for over a year before
membership was even suggested. The fact that we're keeping so
many free servers online now is a testament to the goodwill
Jagex has towards the many thousands of free RuneScape players.
The US$5 monthly membership price is very reasonable considering how much
entertainment you're getting. A cinema visit would give, at most, 2-3 hours of entertainment - RuneScape offers
so much more than that!
</font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
Why not consider becoming a member and help support the continued
development of the game?
</font></i>
</p><p align="justify">
I couldn't have put it better myself. </p><p>
</p><p align="justify">But you cannot put a price on compassion, and so I am by no means
deaf to your cries...

Greetings,
As one of those many residents of your realm living
in poverty, I often find myself wondering: Will these new
graphics be available for even the poorest of RuneScape citizens?
And what if the citizen is using a rustic system to run RuneScape
on? What affect will these new and grand updates have upon us
misfortunates? Your friend and follower,
</font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
Sir Justin
</font></i>
</p><p align="justify">
And I am happy to announce that the answer is an emphatic <b>yes!</b>
Non-members will certainly be going 3-D, and what's more, there
won't be any increased lag as a result. So let's give three
cheers to the mage Andrew - living proof that the best things in
life are indeed free. Which reminds me...
</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
<i><font color="white">
In all candor, I ask that thy might bringith a place for the
learned; a library. This would prove useful for those of which
wish to aquire great knowledge in the history of our great land.
Perhaps if we were literate... we could forge our own tomes,
portraying the history for thine self. Sending Blessings, </font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
Maro </font></i>
</p><p align="justify"><font color="white">
What a splendid idea. I know a building in Varrock that hasn't
seen a lot of action for a while. I'll have a word with the
council, I'm sure that they would be prepared to convert it- such
is their commitment to public institutions.
</font></p><p><font color="white">
</font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white">
Of course all we need now are some books. Histories, stories,
even tales of elves; all these exist but they have been scattered
somewhat in the chaos of the last age or so. So if anyone should
stumble upon any of these, please feel free to pass them onto me.

Well, what a generous week it's been. I feel better now. Perhaps
we should finish on a poem.
