Oh they're real. I think you answered your own question there... <br>
The reason there aren't any bunnies left in RuneScape is so that there 
were enough bunny ears to go around. As it would be cruel to let loose a
 bunch of mutilated animals upon the world (although I personally would 
have found that very funny) The council decided to eat what was left.

always die, and they can presumably take my items. I would use the

Dear Saradomin,<br>
I want to ask about the new that you can't trade holiday items. although
 i understand the idea of people selling them at "outrageous" prices, 
but what would happen if you couldn't get on Runescape that day? You 
would never be able to get the item! I think that if people want to to 
sell them at high price the buyer just has to deal with it.The holiday 
items were one of my favorite ways of getting money. Please respond and 
try to take this rule away.
</i></p><p align="center"><i>
Dakingruler</i>
</p><p align="justify"> Just one example of the hundreds who write to me
 complaining about non tradable and limited bunny ears. They all start 
their email the same way <br>"What if someone wasn't around to get them?"<br> and they all end the same way <br>"I really wanted to make some easy money". </p><p align="justify">Foolish
 mortals... the council once thought it would be a nice present to 
players who were playing on holidays to give them a unique item. <br>This
 has now become an expectation that there will always be rare drops on 
holidays, and that these will be easy ways to make money.
</p><p align="justify">They're not. They're a present. If you weren't playing, you missed out.
<br>I am extremely pleased that the foolish Andrew in an effort to give 
people gifts and make them happy instead manages to annoy people.
</p><p align="justify">It reaffirms my belief in the underlying selfishness of you all.
</p><p align="justify">
I was sent this picture recently of my foolish brother saradomin:
</p><p align="center"><img src="letters11_files/foolsaradomin.jpg" border="0" height="213" width="216">
</p><p align="justify"><i>Whaddya think?</i>
</p><p align="justify">I commend the author on their skill in capturing the ugliness and self satisfied, smug, stupidity of Saradomin so well. <br>Excellent work.
</p><p align="justify">
I just have time to answer a few quick questions before I get back to spreading corruption and death:
</p><p align="justify"> Seamus Aran asks: <i>"What football team/s do you support?" </i><br>
Saradomin likes the Lumbridge Eagles, I prefer the Ardougne Chimeras. 
Guthix says hes not really into competitive sports much. Guthix is kind 
of boring that way.
</p><p align="justify"> Leszek 14 asks: <i>"well where are the trolls????" </i> <br>I
 believe most of them left RuneScape to hang out on Internet message 
boards a while back, although as they are a race I particularly like I 
will be doing my best to bring some back to RuneScape.
</p><p align="justify">Evil Doer asked "<i>what sword you have?</i>"
<br>To which I reply: weapons are for the weak. A True Zamorackian would
 rejoice in nothing less than the slaughter of his enemies with his bare
 fists.
</p><p align="justify">Nyar DCE questions me "<i>How many people work at Jagex?"</i>"
<br>About half, on a good day.
</p><p align="justify">Just pures wrote to say "<i>In runescape there should be some freshing drinks like sprite coca-cola and fanta</i>"
<br>Which amused me no end, as the number of pathetic complaints about 
the adverts that surround the free players game would undoubtedly 
increase if runescape started to have brand name products within the 
game.<br> An excellently evil idea, that I fear the council would never approve of. </p><p align="justify">If
 however any well known drinks manufacturers would like to contact me 
personally with large offers of gold, I will happily have Iban open a 
shop in their name...
</p><p align="justify">MrMario asked "<i>What happened to Saradomin?</i>"
<br>To which I respond, you should not ask too much or I will have no 
course left to me but to demonstrate what I did to the silly old fool 
personally upon you.
<br>It would probably be fatal to a mortal. Its certainly very painful to a god...
</p><p align="justify"> Far far too many people ask: <i>"Whats the deal with those Red Cards?" </i><br> to which I reply, they are given away free at the start of the Tourist Trap quest. </p><p align="justify">
 No, they are not worth thousands of gold... Perhaps it is the word 
'free' in their description that puzzled the weaker minded players 
amongst you?
