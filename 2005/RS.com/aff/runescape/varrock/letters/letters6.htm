Your praises have flown from my mortal lips. In You
there is only but good. Please answer my cry, dear

living the joy that comes with finding one?

different worlds, and its true that I do sometimes have
trouble locating them on the Runescape map. But Saradomin's
mercy crosses all boundaries, and verily these masks were
dropped across a span of fifteen of your hours - such was the dedication of our distributor.

 I have wondered many-a-year if the rules apply to the
place you obvisouly lost control over... The
Wilderness... I mean whenever I attack someone they say very vulgar 
things and some times your good friends will turn on you even after they
 swear
on their mothers graves... I think it is plain that
Zamorak rules the wilderness 100%, look at the two evil churches, 
obviously dedicated to your brother. I suppose if that is his territory 
then you can not help what goes on there... </font></i></font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white"><i><font color="white"> Canvasch

I wonder how meticulous you are about your choice of friends. But you're right in saying that the wilderness
is essentially a Zamorakian affair. It seems that even
the most good-natured of players gets the urge to decapitate
his fellow man occasionally. And so the wilderness enables
them to do this. Of course swearing is still not allowed
in the wilderness, and if someone is verbally offensive to
you, please use the 'report abuse' button.

so much, I would think that they would have exploded or
at least become extremely swelled. They have no way to
'lose' the bulk that they have taken on (besides having
part of them hacked off by a monster). I think that if
your world was to be better, you should have some kind
of digestive system in the people who inhabit RuneScape,
and outhouses or something so that the digestive systems
can fulfill their purposes.

obesity. This is why there is so much walking in Runescape -
to keep players in the peak of fitness. So I don't think
that out-houses are such a pressing concern, although I have

complete an arduous task for a one time privilege.
The ability to change ones' name, without starting over.
There are many such as myself, who in their beginning
naivety chose a whimsical or inappropriate name. Having
risen to a respectable level in all skills, I find
myself longing for an equally respectable name. But

You should not feel ashamed Mr. Lamer. Well, maybe just a little bit. 
But your name is your identity and your birthright, so wear it with 
pride. The important thing
is what your name represents. Are you an untrustworthy scammer,
or a vigorour pursuer of truth? The former will be shunned
by his peers, whilst the latter is embraced. And so the permanence of 
names is of great significance. Whatever your
name is, you must make a name for yourself!

Greetings Saradomin,
</i></font></font></font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white"><font color="white"><font color="white"><i> As all of us on Runescape know, you and your brother
Zamorak quarrel quite a bit. If there was no evil, then
there would be no reason to be good and thus you get
evil. If everything were evil, it would corrupt itself
thus leaving a space open for good. This makes the
quarreling pretty pointless. So I suggest that there be
a god of neutrality to maintain the balance and not let
either side become too powerful. </i></font></font></font></p><p align="justify"><font color="white"><font color="white"><font color="white"><i>
The likelihood of neutrality is one of a studious manner pretty much. 
You have no ambitions, you do not side with others, you are a loner. 
Only when things get out of hand do you take
sides with the minority temporarily. The representative
color would be red (white good, red neutral, black bad,
makes sense). This would prevent, if not stop, the
quarreling between you two. Mind you, I've been getting
terrible migraines lately because of you two.

 Behold, such a god exists - my brother Guthix. He doesn't really do 
much; that's neutrality for you I suppose. But the druids seem to like 
him. </font></font></font></p><p><font color="white"><font color="white"><font color="white">

Null is a mystical guardian who protects you when you first enter new 
areas. He is a passive and benevolent force, and as such his combat 
level never rises above
1. He appears and disappears in order to attend to the needs of all 
those who may require his protection.
