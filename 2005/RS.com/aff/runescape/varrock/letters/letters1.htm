<b>Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god 
Saradomin has finally resumed communication with the inhabitants of this
 fast evolving planet. An agreement with his brothers prohibits him from
 directly intervening into Runescape's affairs, but in his great 
omniscience he still listens to the prayers of those who seek his 
knowledge.</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p align="justify">
Greetings my young adventurers, and a warm welcome to all of you. As I 
look down upon the world that I created, I feel a strong sense of joy 
that it is now home to so many men and women of curious minds and 
adventurous spirits. I am also saddened to see that it is prey to so 
much death and destruction, and I can only assume that my brother 
Zamorak enjoys a large following on this small planet. Perhaps in time 
these mortals will learn of ways to co-exist harmoniously with their 
fellow humans. But for now I am sure that they will continue to hack 
each others heads off with large metal implements.
</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
But it is often said that the tongue can be sharper than the blade, and 
this might explain the latest development from the secular powers that 
be. Although their wisdom may be less than infinite, there can be no 
doubt that the council has performed a small miracle in their creation 
of the snapshot- the latest way to report abuse. This pleases me 
greatly, for slander is the point when pride and stupidity converge. 
When a human disrespects another life, he disrespects his own. </p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td>

<p align="justify">
It all became too much for the mage known as Andrew, whose ability to 
manipulate time means that these foul-mouthed roughians can now be 
caught red-handed by snapshot- even after they have perpetrated their 
crime. The alchemy of reversal is then performed, with said mage adding 
injury to insulter.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Having abused the gift of speech, those brash youths are rewarded by 
having their tongue removed, a practise still favoured by the Mehkmets 
of Al Kharid. Those who truly revel in their idiocy may even find that 
they are excommunicated from Runescape altogether. At this point in time
 it would seem that 439 such wayward fellows have already been 
permanently banned from our great land, with another 995 receiving a 
blackmark against their name.

I of course know that snapshot has proved popular with you young 
adventurers. Indeed, some have been falling over themselves to report 
abuse from their fellow humans, often indirectly reporting themselves in
 the process! Weakened by their own runestones, you might say. So in the
 ongoing war against malice, let us not ourselves malicious be. After 
all, any warrior who hopes to conquer great foes must first be a 
creature of great courage, and possibly not the sort of person who would
 be offended by the word 'noob'... </p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
And so onto your own hopes and prayers. It seems many of you yearn for 
the creation of a four-legged riding creature, commonly referred to as a
 horse. In my all encompassing benevolence I would say that this is not 
necessarily such a bad idea. But alas I have divined that horses would 
be less than happy about living on Runescape. Her rocky terrain and 
dried-out soil would not provide adequate footing for an animal that 
must support the weight of a human on its back. Maybe one day the 
evolutionary conditions could change, but don't start getting excited - 
Runescape wasn't built in a day you know... </p><p align="justify">
Equally popular is the desire for a mine which contains anvils and a 
furnace. "Why can't you have a mine with anvils and a furnace?" you cry,
 "then each adventurer could advance their levels really easily." The 
answer of course is simple. If you had a mine with anvils and a furnace,
 then each adventurer could advance their levels really easily. Come on 
now you slothful creatures. First you want an animal to cart you around 
on its back, and then you want an infinite supply of superior weaponry! </p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
You must know that a hero's status is not chosen or acquired; it is carved into the sheer rock face of hard graft and toil! </p><p align="justify">
And on that note I must return to my other creations. Just remember that
 hard work is always its own reward. And you get to cast some pretty 
good spells as well. </p><p align="justify">
Strength through wisdom

<i>These might be suggestions for Runescape - although the gods do tend 
to be quite touchy about the evolutionary process. You might like to 
send questions relating to the history of the game, or queries about the
 many characters and races that inhabit Runescape. The best letters will
 be published in the email newsletter. Please note that despite their 
omnipotence, the gods of Runescape do not concern themselves with 
customer support.
