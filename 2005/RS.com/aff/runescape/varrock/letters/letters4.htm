<b>Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god Saradomin now regularly

great omniscience he still listens to the prayers of those who seek his knowledge.</b></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

Oh omniscient and powerful Saradomin hear my cry. Your
world called Runescape is based on the magical runes.
But yet a mage of level 99 can still be beaten by the
ones we call "pures". My damage never exceeds 10 for a
magical hit and I have heard of a magic guild with new
runes in it that will soon be made. Higher level
"defense zappers" and such I think will not help the
mages battles with the pures. </p></i>
Oh, how so many of you young mages have begged for a
magic guild. I was tempted to let you just conjure one up
yourself, but then I thought better of it. So those
adventurers who toil on a daily basis will know that a
magic guild now exists in the town of Yanille. There you
can buy a kind of rune that so-called "pures" could only
dream about. <p></p></td><td>

Dear Saradomin,
<br><br>
I know there are a good amount of people who might know
this question but I thought I might as well ask. I would
like to know what the world of runescape was like when
it was first created.

Ah, a historian I see. Well I almost don't know where to
begin. Which is what I said at the time, in fact. But
of course it all started with Lumbridge, and the
good kingdom of Misthalin. But there was no Al Kharid
or Draynor village, and Edgeville was pretty
deserted, so people called it Ghost Town. </p><p align="justify"> The world back then was a comparatively good place.
People didn't tend to wander around Lumbridge calling
each other "noob", because everybody was one. Black
knights were the toughest monsters, of which there were
three. </p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
The top equipment you could get was adamantite legs,
mithril body,adamantite large helmet, adamantite long
sword, and iron kite shield. There were no amulets.
</p><p align="justify">
Adventurers could, however, sink their teeth into six
different quests: the Cook's Assistant, the Restless
Ghost, Demon Slayer, Shield of Arrav, Romeo and Juliet
and Sheep Shearer.
</p><p align="justify">
The main skills were combat, ranged, mining and
smithing. Cooking consisted only of cooking meat and
bread making. Of course, families have always been divided
over the issue of vegetables, and this was literally the
case now, with many a warrior dropping dead from scurvy. </p><p align="justify">
Mourning partners were in time told that there were
plenty more fish in the sea, but this was of little
consolation, as no-one knew how to fish yet. There was
also no crafting, and Lumbridge's traditional Sunday
afternoon craft fairs were a bit of a let down as a
result.

Saradomin, </font></i></p><p align=""><i><font color="white"> I believe the world of Runescape would be much
better if you added music. You should also have bards to
play music as an attack, that would be cool. </font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
Rin Dragon.
</font></i>
</p><p align="justify">
Music as an attack? It really would have to be
offensively bad. But as for music in the game, that
certainly will be coming. For some time now, a great
man-minstrel by the name of Ian has been mincing away, to create great 
scores of majestic sounds that will one day delight your ears. </p><p align="center"></p><table><tbody><tr><td>

Zamorak, your dastardly brother. How am I a loyal
Saradomin follower meant to show my loyalty to you

robes of Saradomin for all your followers out there.

Behold, such robes exist for all to see! Take yourself
to the monastery and speak to the good Abbott Langley
who works there.
And if you are of sufficient prayer
level he will endow you with this most stylish of
artefacts. Just don't let him talk you into a haircut.<br>
And for those of you who have asked about a "prayer
guild", know that you can also pray at their special
altar, and have your holy symbols blessed. </p><p align="center">

I think iron ores should be 100% success or at least
more than 50% once I only got 4 iron bars out of 17 iron

just change my mind.

Dear Wise One,
<br></i></p><p align="justify"><i> Twice in my travels, I have encountered a strange
warrior who seemed very knowledgeable in this world. The
warrior's name was "Paul" and seemed to be very
important. The first meeting of him and I was in south
west chapel near Port Sarim. I saw a man dressed in
robes supposedly performing the vows of marriage for two
people. The second time I witnessed this person was near
the Desert at Easter. At this time I said a friendly
greeting to him and he responded with a similar
greeting, and then disappeared, leaving many Easter Eggs
that my travelling partner immediately picked up. Who is
this mysterious person and why are they so elusive?
</i></p><p align="justify"><i> Petros
</i>
</p><p align="justify"> Yes, the Paul that you speak of is a strange one
indeed, who has been known to float around Runescape
like some sort of all-powerful jellyfish, squeezing out
offerings at certain special times of year. Some of you
have even wondered if there might be another deployment
of goodies in the near future. I couldn't possibly
comment on this of course...
</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
Until next time my friends.
<br></p><p> </p><p align="justify">
Strength through wisdom,
<br></p><p> </p><p align="justify"> Saradomin </p><p>

These might be suggestions for Runescape - although the gods do tend to be
quite touchy about the evolutionary process. You might like to send questions
relating to the history of the game, or queries about the many characters and
races that inhabit Runescape. The best letters will be published in the email
newsletter.
