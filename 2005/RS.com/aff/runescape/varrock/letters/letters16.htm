Rumours are the refuge of the braggard, and the scoundrel. Put not thy 
faith in rumour, for often they shall deceive intentionally, and the 
rare occasion that they doth find the grain of truth ist not worthy of

I can tell thee true however, the first three rumours that thou mention

Why does Guthix exist? It has been this one's experience that any and 
every god which doesn't have followers will cease to be, yet the gods of
 Runescape seem to exist independently of human belief. Is there 
something about Runescape itself that allows this, or is it the gods 
themselves?<br>
</i></p><center><i>Vkand</i></center>
<p align="justify">
Thy assumption is mostly correct noble philosopher; most gods mayst not 
stay long on a plane where their existence ist not demanded by 
followers. <br>
Just speaking the name of a god canst give them power enough to enter this plane, and with followers then they mayst remain. </p><p align="justify">
I am not most gods however; mine power is drawn from the land, from the 
seas, from the plants and trees, from the very essences of life that 
dwell here. This is why I neither seek nor demand loyalty from mine 
followers, for my power is not that of belief, but of life. <br>
The only thing that couldst disrupt mine energies wouldst be the 
extinction of all life upon this realm, in which case I wouldst be 
forced from this realm to find another. I would never allow such an 
abomination against balance to occur here.

I am one of the few players of Runescape who are actually not looking 
forward to the update. I use the incredibly powerful operating system we
 mortals call OS X (10.2.6 to be exact). I am worried that the update 
might only be available to the misguided majority of users using the 
bloated operating system know as "Windows". Can you tell me if I be 
barred form playing Runescape because I choose to be productive on my 
computer?

I hath good news for thee, for the strength of the language known as 
Java is that it doth operate upon its own structure, so that it is 
universally understood by all, no matter what their native language may 
be. <br>
Thus it is that a man known as Windows may speak happily with a man 
known as Macintosh, by speaking in Java, despite each being born knowing
 a different language. It is a universal language for all; this is one 
of it's major strengths.

Hi great guthix,<br>
I was wondering if there are any more gods other then you,Saradomin,and

library.<br>

</p><p align="justify">
There are at least twenty deities who didst force themselves upon this 
realm whilst I slumbered, Saradomin and Zamorak are the two who hath 
most prominence amongst the general populace.
</p><p align="justify">
As to thy query regarding the histories of the library, I hath knowledge
 that such an addition is indeed planned, but treacherous Zamorak takes 
strange delight in the torture of the man responsible, Reldo.<br>
This puzzles me greatly, for he hath never struck me as anything more 
than a mild mannered creature devoted solely to the studies of 
scholarship.

Tell me... you claim to be the god the represents balance, like in 
neutrality. And you name is Guthix. But from the moment you have a name,
 you aren't neutral anymore. In the last letter you told zidane_909 : "I
 am beyond good or evil, I am simply Guthix." That's means you chose or 
like the name yourself. So you aren't neutral, because you favor 
something.

Each god receives questions in the magnitude of hundreds daily, and

Although many are received and all are read, only a few are selected for
 response - thou will probably be glad to know, for thou art known to us
 as a quizzical thinker Lord Duckman, and although thy many questions 
are not necessarily answered, they all reach their destination. </p><p align="justify">
As to thy query regarding the co-operation of Saradomin and Zamorak with
 myself upon a letters response, I fear that making the two arch-enemies
 co-operate upon anything, even something as minor as responding to 
their followers, is a task beyond even my powers... <br>...and I 
personally find clowns to be unfunny bufoons who willst degrade their 
lives for an attempt at a cheap laugh; but I am not known for my sense 
of humour.

Dear Guthix, <br>
When you revamp runescape, will all the places be different, like will 
the world map be the same? It would take a lot of time to get used to a 
completely new runescape. many people would quit. The result of making 
to many massive changes would be a long time without revenue. </i></p><p align="justify"><i>

changed. Continents, seas, rivers, mountains and cities shall remain 
similar to their existing selves, yet shall be different enough to 
briefly disorient those who rely on existing landmarks for direction.<br>
I hath already claimed the restoration of this world will be total, from
 each blade of grass, to the highest mountain - and my claim was not 
made with exaggeration. </p><p align="center"><img src="letters16_files/smstones.jpg"></p><p align="justify"><i>
Guthix,
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
Truly you are a mighty god, but I am quite confused. In his first 
letters, Sardomin said that HE created Runescape. In your first letter 
(thankfully I got to hear from the third god) though, you said YOU 
created Runescape. Who is puffing themselves up, and who is lying, I 
wonder? I used to be a follower of Sardomin, but now I doubt my ways. Am
 I to be a follower of you, of Zamorak, or stay the way I am? Or to be 
an atheist? Or is that the way of Guthix (to be atheist)? And how would I
 know if YOU were the one puffing himself up?... :\ Meep. My head hurts 
now.
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
-Blast-chan</i>
</p><p align="justify">
I claim not the creation of Gielinor; I claim it's rightful ownership, for none other dwelled here when first I arrived.<br>
I knowst not why Saradomin would claim otherwise, other than in a bid 
for glory, for all other gods came to this plane whilst I slumbered.

Greeting o' wise and powerful Guthix,
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
I wouldst like to ask thee some questions concerning the dwarves, and 
their mine. 'Twas my understanding that dwarven smiths were the greatest
 in all runescape, and that their skill in metalworking was rivaled only
 by their fondness of being alone. These facts dist lead me to wonder, 
where is their furnace? Surely they do not journey all the way to 
Falador merely to smelt the ore that they so diligently mine, and trek 
back again to hammer it? If that is indeed the case then they canst turn
 themselves invisible for I have never seen one in the city. I 
understand that it would be too easy to train smithing if all citizens 
of runescape had access to dwarven furnaces, but could they not be 
persuaded to grant us use if we completed a quest for them?

dear holy and unholy one,
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
two quick questions. <br>
1) in the intrest of balance, do you do everything, or nothing?<br>
2) is your name pronounced guh-thicks or goo-thicks? it's gotten really 
annoying... or should i just accept both in the intrest of balance?
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
thank you,<br>
mase windu</i>
</p><p align="justify">
I do anything and everything necessary to maintain balance - it is a far
 more time consuming occupation than might first be considered. </p><p align="justify">
As to thy second question, my true name is not pronouncable by human 
form, yet it's closest approximation in the language of man is 
'guh-thicks'.
</p><p align="center"><img src="letters16_files/smstones.jpg"></p><p align="justify"><i>
Guthix, it's clear that the Druids follow you and your philosophy of 
balance (if it can be called a philosophy rather than a lack of 
one...confusing). <br>
But what about Chaos Druids? The beastiary informs me that they follow 
the dual philosophies of you and Zamorak, but I'm a bit unclear on how 
that would be possible. Neutral, but not neutral? Evil, but not evil? 
What's your thoughts?
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
Haldir2012</i>
</p><p align="justify">
The chaos druids acknowledge mine position as the eldest and most 
powerful deity, and still strive for my ultimate aim of balance upon 
this land; but unlike the more passive actions taken by their 
non-chaotic brethren, they take an active role in culling this land of 
the more prolific species which inhabit it. </p><p align="justify">
Man is the most prolific race that dwelleth upon this realm, and it is mankind that they take most pleasure in dispatching. <br>
This is also an aim of Zamoraks, and so they doth serve two masters through striving for this one goal.
</p><p align="center"><img src="letters16_files/smstones.jpg"></p><p align="justify"><i>
Dear Guthix,
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
How can you stand to not choose between good or evil? Doesn't it get 
boring being neutral all the time? Do Zamorak and Saradomin ever get mad
 at you for not supporting either of them? (Not that Saradomin would get
 mad at anyone) I just don't see how you can take it.
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
Just wondering,
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
Mr. Beef Wellington
</i></p><p align="justify"><i>
P.S. Do you have to talk so wierd?? I can barely understand you!</i>
</p><p align="justify">
I am balance, not neutrality - neutrality doth suggest inaction, when 
the oposite is the truth. I willst take ANY action necessary to ensure 
balance upon mine plane, and as such, mine actions canst be deemed to be
 good or evil depending on howst they affect thee. In truth, they are 
neither - they art merely <b>necessary</b>. </p><p align="justify">
As to the 'weirdness' of mine language: the language of man is not 
native to myself, and hast changed greatly since last I had use for it. <br>
I canst not express myself clearer than this, for thine language is both alien and strange to me.
</p><p align="center"><img src="letters16_files/smstones.jpg"></p><p align="justify"><i>
Almighty gods...
I have roamed the lands of runescape for serveral years now and have 
fought valiantly against all monsters i happened to encounter. I've hit 
from '0' to '29' but i've never 'missed' a single hit... i instead hit a
 0... how is it that i am so accurate in my hitting that i never miss 
the monsters? i must agree that this makes me see this world as 
undeveloped. It vexes me to see that i never miss... though i quite like
 not missing... it is quite unrealistic....<br>

I beg to differ with thy experience in combat. <br>
Often do I see skilled warriors attack each other, yet hit at a bad 
angle and provide merely a glancing blow that causes no damage, or have 
their attack slighted due to armour: rarely do I see a warrior with any 
weapons training utterly miss an opponent at close range...
