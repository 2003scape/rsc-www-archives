Hello, hello, lord of all evil doers. As I read the 9th issue of the 
Letters on Runescape.com, I found myself surprised and pleased...my god,
 Zamorak, had returned to communicate with us! As I read over the 
letters, I found myself laughing with DELIGHT!!! This was the one I 
worshipped and served, and rightfully so. I want you to know I am 
personally training everyday to tear apart those followers of the weak 
and goody-goody "Sardomin" or whatever his goofy name is. Keep blessing,
 errr, cursing your devoted followers. </i></p><p><i>

holy symbol, why don't you?

Hmmm, it's funny you should mention that. I happen to know that the 
Council of Runescape is toying with the idea of some sort of speed burst
 or running ability,
which would probably induce fatigue. So well done on anticipating this 
change: Great minds think alike. Fools seldom differ.

I have been told that in the wilderness at the very end their is full

love the wilderness I thought that you might prove this or disprove 
this. From what i hear you are ignorant of answering questions but I 
have a good reason for you to answer this one.

Well I'm certainly not ignorant of anything. A tad lazy maybe... but since this
is a newsletter I can hardly "prove" that this is in fact untrue. I can only
"tell you" that it is a blatant lie, presumably designed to lure foolish
adventurers towards the mythical bounty, like a sailor to a siren. So full marks to whoever came up with it.

Yes, when the new game engine update happens it will include weapons with their own special

slashes.

I recently read that multiple player combat would be available in the 
3-d version. Most people would think this is a good idea, but i know 
from experience it is not. Before I played runescape, I played another 
MMORPG which had this same system and it was great and all, until the 
game got popular (about as popular as runescape) and the game was filled
 with dishonest lower lvl. These people would constantly deal just a 
death
blow on the monster your fighting to get the drop...<br>
Unless you make it so there is an option to turn off multiple player 
combat for the monsters that particular person is fighting, I urge you 
not to apply this update, well, stop Andrew from making the update, you 
have evil powers right?

The details of multi-player fighting are still being decided, but there 
will be an option to disable multi-player fighting for those who want to
 fight alone. I do know that the revamped game system will allow us to 
have a combat system that is very fair and accurate in it's designation 
of hits and scores. I did try to argue with Andrew
against all this fairness, but he wasn't having it.
