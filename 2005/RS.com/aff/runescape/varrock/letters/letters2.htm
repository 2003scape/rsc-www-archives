<b>Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god 
Saradomin now regularly communicates with the inhabitants of this fast 
evolving planet. An agreement with his brothers prohibits him from 
directly intervening into Runescape's affairs, but in his great 
omniscience he still listens to the prayers of those who seek his 
knowledge.</b></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

Firstly, I must say that I was touched by the level of response to my 
first letter. Truly I say that Runescape is home to such a myriad of 
peoples, including some that now transcend the more traditional 
etiquette of grammar and punctuation. But above all I was struck by the 
sincerity of your words- it is a great thing indeed to live with such a 
strong sense of hope. </p><p align="justify">I have received a huge 
number of messages, so I alas cannot reply to every single one here. But
 how pleased Saradomin was to hear from men and women with such strong, 
seeking minds!

Firstly, and, methinks, my best idea, is to make daggers throwable. The 
advantage? A dagger packs more punch than an arrow (conceivably) and one
 would not find it necessary to carry a bow. This would also provide an 
actual use for daggers, whereas before they were the weapon of a noob or
 someone driven quite insane on the apothecary's latest experiment. 
Those who fancy themselves the dashing thief would be quite glad to be 
able to wield daggers, the thief's weapon of lore. The better the dagger
 (bronze as opposed to rune) the more damage it would do. </p></font></i><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">

An interesting idea, a dagger that can be thrown- something that you 
would only do, I presume, in order to defend yourself. I can confirm 
that plans are now afoot to give knives the gift of flight, and that 
this action will be part of the ranged skill series. Unlucky recipients 
of said knives will then find their health to be substantially lessened.
 These weapons will not, however, be stackable, so sadists will have to 
find other ways to satiate their Zamorockian urges.</td><td> <p align="centre"><img src="letters2_files/dwarf.jpg" height="173" width="155"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><font color="white">

I was, of course, gratified to learn that so many of you are indeed 
committed to the hard graft and toil that I spoke of last time. Or as 
one adventurer puts it:</p><p>
</p><center><i><font color="white">
Oh great and powerful Saradomin. I beg of thee. Please grant me an Idiot
 Repelling Amulet so that I can work in peace and not be bugged for 
hours by children who covet what I have worked so hard to achieve. Why 
must I repeatedly state that I am not selling some piece of armor or 
weapon over and over again?

Others were motivated by a desire for justice, fervently demanding that 
certain secular decisions be overturned at once. Rather than engaging 
with those who would seek to Support their Custom, it would seem that 
the sheer passion of these individuals got the better of them... so they
 pestered me instead. But Runescape does have a process of evolution, 
and I am sure that it will be reaching them soon. </p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
But if you need customer support, please use the customer support forms! And so back to business.

</p><center><i><font color="white">
My Lord, long have I worshipped your greatness. I wander the lands 
preaching your wisdom to the masses, hoping to enlight even one mind. 
"Bury your bones", I proclaim to the huddled masses. "Saradomin is with 
you" I announce to any great warriors I see. Day and night I strive to 
raise my prayer level, hoping, it will will bring me closer to your all 
encompassing light. It is the purpose that drives me, it is the will 
that binds me, it is my reason for being on this world (Runescape). And 
so I ask you, might you create another quest that raises prayer? Much 
would be the rejoicing if this came to be.
<p align="justify">
Your loyal servant, tom505</p></font></i><p><i><font color="white">

Now certain members of the council are seeking out new ways to level 
your prayer skill. Perhaps by way of a quest. Not that I would ever 
intervene directly into the affairs of RuneScape of course...

Greetings oh Mighty One... Whilst one understands that questioning the 
way in which You (in your infinite wisdom) have created Runescape is 
liable to cause offence and thus painful injury to the interrogator - 
the ache in one's legs is such that the question can no longer be 
withheld. In essence - your servant has been whacking the living 
daylights out of monsters, picking flax 'til her fingers bleed, pounding
 rocks and baking like there is no tomorrow, for day upon endless day 
and now finds herself exhausted, with varicose veins and blisters. Oh 
for the blessed relief of a nice little sit down with one of brother 
Galahad's cups of tea, or ...miracle of miracles...a sleep! Those 
tempting looking beds with their *nice blankets* ..those *sturdy looking
 chairs*. One wonders why You created these taunting items of furniture 
when Your subjects cannot use them? One is sure there must be a 
perfectly good reason but not being a mighty god such as yourself 
(grovel) one cannot think of it.
</font></i></p><p align="justify"><i><font color="white">
Strength through wisdom? Strength through taking the weight of these ankles more like!

</font></i><font color="white"><p align="justify"><i>
P.S. If one must be turned into an imp for this impertinence please let 
it not be on Karamja - walking on hot laval rock would play havoc with 
my bunions...</i>
</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
Now as the god of all things good, there are some matters which simply 
demand my full and undivided attention. This was not one such matter. 
But you did arouse my sympathies- even the gods feel weary sometimes you
 know. </p><p align="justify">
But the question on nearly everyone's lips was when that of when our 
world would enter a new dimension. Gazing across to the mage Andrew - 
for we are not one and the same- I see that three-dimensional landscapes
 are now under construction. There is still much work to be done of 
course. When you seek to change the world, you take on every blade of 
grass. Carpentry has for this reason been postponed until after the 
updates. </p><p align="justify">
This will doubtless prove disappointing to some, but then even the gods can't please everyone. In the words of one adventurer:
</p><p align="justify">
<i><font color="white">
"I got told by a friend the Runescape graphics are going to turn into 
really good graphics... if this is true, don't do it, as it would wreck 
the game."
</font></i>
</p><p align="justify">
Oh how I laughed. Even the Andrew was said to have managed a smile- which is no mean feat I can tell you.
</p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
All in all I can see that these are happy times for the people of 
Runescape. The perpetrators of deceit are being hounded out, with over 
60 scam sites being taken down in the last week. The new combat level 
display has proved popular amongst merchant types, with traders now 
having to try really hard to get ripped off. Perhaps my presence has 
tipped the balance of power away from all those who would promote evil. </p><p align="justify">
Or maybe it's just been a good week. Until next time my friends.
</p><p align="justify">
Strength through wisdom<br>

<i>These might be suggestions for Runescape - although the gods do tend 
to be quite touchy about the evolutionary process. You might like to 
send questions relating to the history of the game, or queries about the
 many characters and races that inhabit Runescape. The best letters will
 be published in the email newsletter. Please note that despite their 
omnipotence, the gods of Runescape do not concern themselves with 
customer support.
