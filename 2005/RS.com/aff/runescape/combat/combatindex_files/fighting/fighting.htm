<center><b>Fighting</b></center><p>

</p><center><b>Initiating Combat</b></center><p>
To fight a monster or character in the game just point your mouse at 
your opponent and select the 'attack' option. 
Not every character in the game can be attacked, so if no attack option 
is visible on the menu, then the character is probably part of some 
quest or shop, and is not designed to be fought. 
</p><p>
When you point the mouse at your opponent their relative strength will be indicated next to their name.
</p><p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><img src="fighting_files/npc1.htm"></td><td>
In the example here the goblin can be seen to be a level-2 monster. 
This is also coloured coded to help you decide if you should fight or 
not. If your opponent is weaker than you the indicator is shown in 
green, for equal opponents it is shown in yellow, whereas for stronger 
opponents it is shown in red.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
In addition to their level some monsters will be stronger if they have 
weapons or armour. Some creatures have natural armour or weapons. A 
unicorn has a horn and a giant scorpions carapace provide natural 
armour.
Be wary about attacking monsters which are marked as much stronger than 
you. You could easily die before you get a chance to retreat. Some of 
the more aggressive monsters - particularly ones which dwell further 
away from the cities, or in the dungeon, will attack you if you just 
move near to them so be careful where you go to start with!
</p><p>
</p><center><b>Combat styles</b></center>
<p>
To select the combat style you are using  you will need select the 
crossed sword icon on the player interface. Different weapons will have 
different choices of combat styles.
<table><tbody><tr><td>
Choosing 'accurate' will make you more likely to hit your opponent. 
Choosing 'aggressive' means that when you do hit your opponent you are 
likely to do more damage. 'Defensive' makes your opponent less likely to
 hit you. Whereas 'controlled' simply improves all three by a smaller 
amount. The combat style you select also affects which stats you gain 
experience points in when you kill the monster.
</td><td valign="top"><img src="fighting_files/npc2.htm"></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
The different combat styles will also have different damage types, 
'crush', 'slash' and 'stab', different monsters will have be weaker 
against different damage types.
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="fighting_files/npc3.htm"></td><td valign="top">
The amount of  damage each combat participant has taken is indicated by a
 horizontal bar above their head. If your bar is entirely green you are 
not hurt, it will turn red as you are hit. If the bar goes entirely red 
your character will die. A number will also briefly appear over you 
whenever you are hit by your opponent, indicating how many points of 
damage you have just sustained.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
If you find you are losing the battle, then you can run away by clicking on the ground. 
If you do retreat it's best to keep moving, as monsters will pursue you and carry on hitting you. 
If you run far enough away monsters will give up the chase.
</p><p></p><center><b>Multiway combat areas</b></center><p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
There are some areas where multiple players can fight monsters and 
multiple monsters can fight players. These areas are called multicombat 
areas and a pair of crossed swords will appear in the bottom left corner
 of the screen to indicate you are in such an area.
</td><td valign="top">

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p></p><center><b>Dying</b></center><p>
Dying isn't much fun, so we recommend you avoid it. However most players
 will sooner or later get into a fight they can't win and end up losing 
all their hitpoints. Luckily death in RuneScape isn't permanent and 
after a few moments you will reappear in Lumbridge.
</p><p>
You keep all your stats and skills, BUT you drop the items you are 
carrying! It is unlikely you will be able to retrieve them so we 
recommend you keep as many of your valuables in the bank as possible. If
 you haven't attacked any other players recently (see section on player 
killing) you will also keep your 3 most valuable items. But you won't 
keep stackable items like coins, runes, arrows, etc.
</p><p></p><center><b>Combat skills</b></center><p>
