</p><center><b>Fighting other players</b></center><p>
As well as fighting the computer controlled monsters and characters you 
can also choose to directly fight with other players. Fighting against 
other players is often a lot more dangerous because they have a much 
greater variety of ways to fight than monster
</p><p>
Also in multiway combat areas watch out because their friends could be lurking behind a tree ready to finish you off!
</p><p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="pking_files/player1.htm"></td><td>
Killing other players can potentially give great rewards if they are 
holding valuable items. However attacking another player sets your 
alignment to 'evil', and a skull appears above your head to indicate 
this. As longer as your player is marked with a skull the risk is 
greater. If you die you will drop everything you are holding (you won't 
get to keep your 3 best items like you normally do!). If you play for 20
 minutes without attacking anyone, the skull will disappear and the 3 
item protection will work again.
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Not everybody likes fighting other players, so to do it you have to go 
to a special area of the map known as 'the wilderness'. Reaching the 
wilderness is easy, just keep on walking north and eventually you will 
get there. The wilderness is a desolate area full of death and danger. 
As well as the extra risk of attack from other players there are also 
many nasty monsters. However the rewards are also greater, and there is 
more treasure to be found if you dare to enter this area.
</p><p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
When you enter the wilderness an icon at the bottom right of the screen 
will appear to remind you. This also indicates how far into the 
wilderness you have gone. The further north you go the more dangerous 
the wilderness becomes. At the south edge of the wilderness you can only
 fight with players who are a very similar level to yourself, whereas as
 you go north the range allowed increases, and by the north edge players
 of vastly different abilities can engage in combat and the danger is 
great!
</td><td><img src="pking_files/player2.htm"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>
A further note to those with the power of teleportation - the evil auras
 that have built up in the wilderness are blocking teleportation to 
wilderness levels above 20.

Specific Playerkilling tactics</b></p></center><p>

<b>Mage vs Warrior</b></p><p>


<i></i></p><p><i>WARRIOR</i></p><p>
The mage will likely attempt to "hold" the warrior as quickly as 
possible, retreat to a safe distance and unleash with some spells. Since
 all of the big armour (plate and chain) carries negative bonuses to 
magical defence, your best plan is to take off all your armour or change
 to more appropriate attire, such as Dragonhide or studded leather. <br>
Quick thrown weapons are a good way to distract your opponent, and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923010939/http://www.runescape.com/aff/runescape/skills/herblore.html" class="c">poison</a>
 him / her. This may give the warrior a few seconds to get in close and 
hit the mage with his primary weapon. The mage is not likely to be 
wearing any armour, so don't worry about which attack style you are 
using.

<i></i></p><p><i>MAGE</i></p><p>
The warrior is dangerous at close range and useless at any distance - 
the simple tactics are to hold the warrior using one of the bind spells 
and start firing in damaging spells, or weaken or confuse your opponent 
from distance.<br>
If the player gets in close defend yourself using your staff and wait 
for another opportunity to hold them. If you're a particularly high 
level mage, you may be able to wear some armour while fending off the 
warriors advances and continue hitting him with your spells. Do remember
 that the armour will reduce your ability to cast magic.

<b></b></p><p><b>Warrior vs Ranger</b></p><p>

<i></i></p><p><i>WARRIOR</i></p><p>
You have excellent defence vs rangers if you're wearing your standard 
plate set, so you have little to worry about. Make sure you have a few <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923010939/http://www.runescape.com/aff/runescape/skills/herblore.html" class="c">cure poison potions</a> to stop the blighter from sticking you with a poisoned arrow and wade into him with your primary weapon.<br> 
If he is using Dragonhide or leather armour, your best bet is to hack him down with stabbing or slashing weapons.

<i></i></p><p><i>RANGER</i></p><p>
This is your toughest fight. A warrior has excellent defence vs your 
projectile attacks, and your armour is unlikely to stand up to the 
battering from a well placed blade. One available option is to run and 
get some distance between you and your target - hopefully put a forest 
between you so you can rain arrows down while he / she is picking her 
way through the forest. If the warrior gets close your in trouble.<br>
You could put on some chainmail instead as this offers better protection
 from the warrior, but offers no bonus to your ranged attack. Try to 
lead the warrior to a busier area; with any luck the warrior will get 
distracted and you can retreat to distance. Poisoning your projectiles 
is always useful as this can often distract the warrior for a few vital 
seconds.

<b></b></p><p><b>Ranger vs mage</b></p><p>

<i></i></p><p><i>RANGER</i></p><p>
Your leather armours give you the best defence vs spells, so you won't 
be getting hit that often by his magic. Fortunately for you, Robes offer
 no protection against your projectiles so stand back and turn him into a
 pin-cushion. At close ranges use throwing weapons and your shortbows, 
as they are quick and effective.<br>
If the Mage tries to run you can pull out your longbow, with a much 
greater range than any other weapon he will have trouble getting out of 
your reach. Always use poisoned weapons if you can, as the extra damage 
really adds up.

<i></i></p><p><i>MAGE</i></p><p>
Rangers will give you the most trouble, as your hold spells won't affect
 their ability to attack you. In addition, they often have a very good 
defence vs magic due to their leather armour, particularly if they are 
wearing Dragonhide. Leather is also fairly strong against Crush attacks,
 so your staff won't be too much use up close either.
Your best bet is to just blast away with your best damage spells and 
hope they hit; forget using your other spells as they won't help.<br> 
You'll probably need some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923010939/http://www.runescape.com/aff/runescape/skills/herblore.html" class="c">cure poison potions</a>, as arrows/daggers/darts/and javelins can all be poisoned.
If all else fails, you can always run to the lower wilderness and teleport out.
