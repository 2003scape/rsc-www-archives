</p><ol>
<li>Try connecting to a different 'world' (UK or US). If one of our servers is experiencing technical issues
this will solve the problem for you whilst we get it fixed. 
<p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>Your browser may be caching an old version of the game - try clearing your web-cache.
<p>
To do this in Internet-Explorer
<br><br>-Point at the 'tools' menu
<br>-Select 'internet options'
<br>-Click the button to delete your temporary internet files
</p><p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>On the 'play-game' page (the one where you select between free and members), you will see a scroll
at the bottom of the page. Click on the drop down menu on this scroll and select "Signed Applet using SUN Java"
and then proceed to load the game as normal. This will often fix the problem.
<p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>Ensure that you have accepted the popup security warning that appears a few seconds
after choosing your game server. If this popup does not appear try rebooting your machine, and make
sure you click "yes" when asked if you want to trust the RuneScape applet.
<p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>On the 'play-game' page (the one where you select the Level of Detail), you will see a scroll 
at the bottom of the page. Click on the drop down menu on this scroll and select "Unsgied Applet using default Java"
and then proceed to load the game as normal. This will often fix the problem if you are playing from a school
machine or internet-cafe where you have limited access to the computer.
<p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>Download the mozilla web-browser from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="new">www.mozilla.org</a> and try using that to play RuneScape
<p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>Our servers may be temporarily offline for maintenance or an update, try waiting an hour and then 
trying again.
<p>
<b>If this doesn't fix your problem then try:</b>
<br><br></p></li><li>Make sure your computer is sufficiently powerful to play RuneScape. To run RuneScape we recommend
you have at least 64 meg of RAM, and at least a 300mhz computer. If your machine isn't very fast make sure
you close all unnecessary program before running RuneScape.
<p>
If it STILL won't work then sorry we really can't help you. If despite trying all the above it still won't work then
it is likely someone is deliberately blocking you from playing RuneScape, talk to your network administrator.

<br><br>
This problem is normally caused by either playing RuneScape from a slow 
computer, or by a poor quality internet connection between your computer
 and our server. Even if you're using a super-fast computer connected 
using an ultra fast cable link it's still possible that one of the 
machines on the route from us to you isn't up to the task, and so you 
might get poor performance sometimes. 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
<b>To reduce the problem you can: </b>
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3"> 
a) try playing on one of our servers in a different country, for 
instance even if you live in the US you might bizzarely get a better 
link to our UK servers. 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
b) make sure there aren't any other programs using your 
internet-connection. Close any unnecessary software. In particular don't
 try playing RuneScape at the same time as downloading files or swapping
 music, as this doesn't work very well! 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
c) try playing at a different time of day when the Internet is quieter 
and the various routers across the internet aren't overloaded. 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
d) whilst playing the game press the F1 key. This will cause the game to
 miss out some of the graphics and pixels which should hopefully make 
the screen update a bit faster 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
e) On the 'play-game' page (the one where you select between free and 
members), you will see a scroll at the bottom of the page. Try clicking 
on the drop down menu on this scroll and select "Signed Applet using SUN
 Java" and then proceed to load the game as normal. 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
f) ensure your Java Just-In-Time compiler for virtual machine is 
enabled. In Internet Explorer, under: 
tools-&gt;internet-options-&gt;advanced-&gt;Microsoft VM 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
g) try playing from a faster computer :-)
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
 h) try using a different ISP (internet-server-provider) 
</a></p><p><a name="techfaq3">
Our servers have a very good internet link, (we have over 90mbps of 
dedicated bandwidth) so it's unlikely to be a problem at our end.

</a></p><p><a name="techfaq4"><b><font color="#ffbb22">I'm trying to login but it says my username is already in use!</font></b>

</a></p><p><a name="techfaq4">
<b>There are three things that can cause this: </b>
<br><br>
</a></p><ul><a name="techfaq4">
<li>If you were playing a few minutes ago and didn't log out properly 
your user may still be connected to the server. After a short while you 
will be logged out automatically so wait a few minutes and then try 
again. 
</li><li>You will occasionally see this message when we are upgrading 
the servers. Look on the RuneScape webpage, and if one or more of the 
servers is showing 0-players then its probably the reason. Just wait a 
few minutes for us to finish the upgrade and then login as normal. 
</li><li>If the servers seem to be working normally for everyone else, 
and you cannot login after waiting a while then someone may have your 
password and is using your account. </li></a></ul><a name="techfaq4">

</a></p><p><a name="techfaq5">
Runescape members using the SUN java plug-in will not be able to hear 
sounds from the game. Our development team is currently working hard to 
correct this, but in the short-term, consider using the Microsoft java 
plug-in.

Check you haven't accidently changed the in-game config options. For 
information on how to check these, please refer to the RuneScape manual.
