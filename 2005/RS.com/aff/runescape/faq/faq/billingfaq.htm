<font color="#ffbb22"><b>Which subscription methods do you offer?</b></font><br>
The subscription methods available differ depending upon which country you are subscribing from.<br>
When you go to 'subscribe' from the Secure Services menu, all of the payment options available to you will be shown.<br>
For an overview of the payment options, please click on the following links: </a><a href="#worldpay" class="c">WorldPay</a>, <a href="#paybycash" class="c">PayByCash</a>, <a href="#paybyphone" class="c">PayByPhone</a> or <a href="#paybysms" class="c">PayBySMS</a>.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>Can I pay for membership for someone else?</b></font><br>
You may only do this if the person is a member of your immediate family.
 Otherwise it is not allowed. This is necessary to help us detect and 
prevent fraud. Ignoring this warning may result in both your accounts 
being banned.<br>
If you wish to purchase membership for someone outside your family we 
recommend you just give them the money and let them purchase the 
membership themselves directly using one of our many payment methods.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>Do I pay per computer or per account?</b></font><br>
You pay per account, you need to pay the subscription charge for each 
account you wish to upgrade. You can then use this account from any 
computer you wish.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>If I am a member, can I access both RuneScape and RS Classic members' servers?</b></font><br>
Membership is assigned to a character, you are able to play on both 
RuneScape and RS Classic whenever you wish and the member's servers on 
both games will always be available to all members.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>What is your refunds policy?</b></font><br>
Refunds are given at the discretion of the management. We don't normally
 refund victims of in-game 'scamming' since there are many warnings 
about avoiding this on our website. We will however do everything 
possible to help members recover stolen accounts/passwords.<br>
We also won't give refunds to users who have been 'banned' for violating our terms+conditions of use.<br>
If your case is exceptional and you feel a refund is justified please contact </a>

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>What will happen to my members items if I cancel my subscription?</b></font><br>
If you cancel your subscription, your members benefits will be frozen 
until you renew your subscription and you are able to access the 
members' server. You will only be able to access the first page of your 
RuneScape bank, and will not be able to use any member’s items on the 
free servers.

If you cancel your subscription, your account retains member status 
until the credit that you have paid for is used up. After this your 
account will revert to 'free-player' status and you will no longer be 
able to access any members' benefits.

Only direct debit subscriptions need to be cancelled. All of the 
PayByCash payments subscribe your character for a limited term; you will
 not be re-billed and so do not need to cancel. If you do not subscribe 
again, your membership will automatically end when your credit expires.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>Why is this process more expensive than other payment options?</b></font><br>
PayByPhone and PayBySMS are more expensive as compared to paying by 
credit/debit card, because it is more expensive for Jagex to operate 
this more convenient payment method. Jagex earns the same revenues as 
with other paying methods. The additional fee goes to the phone 
operator.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>When I dial the PayByPhone number the call does not go through</b></font><br>
Please check with your telephone operator if your line is blocked from 
making calls to a premium rate number. The possible reasons can be that 
the bill payer has blocked dialing premium number, a call made to a 
premium rate number has been disputed previously or you are calling from
 a business line.
</a></p><p><a name="paybyphone3">
If there is a block on 900 or premium rate calls then you will need to 
check with the person who pays the telephone bill before getting the 
block lifted.

PayByPhone and PayBySMS are only available to players in certain 
countries.

These services only become accessible when you have less than fourteen 
days of credit on your account. If you have more than fourteen days of 
membership credit, then you will not be able to use the service at this 
time.

This payment option is only available to customers in the UK, it is run by MetaCharge one of our billing partners.
</p><p>
We provide the number to send the text to and the code you need to 
include in the text message.
When you send the text message to MetaCharge, they will respond with one
 initial text message, if this is successfully transmitted to your 
mobile phone, then three subsequent messages will be sent shortly 
afterwards. 
</p><p>
The first text from MetaCharge will include a PIN; you need to enter 
this PIN into the payment window to redeem your month of membership.
</p><p>
When you redeem the PIN, one month of membership will be added to your account.
</p><p>
If you have a prepaid mobile phone the credit will be removed from your 
phone, otherwise the cost of the text will be added to your mobile phone
 bill.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>I have used the PayBySMS service, but did not receive whole month of membership</b></font><br>
When you subscribed, MetaCharge were unable to transmit all of the four 
text messages to your mobile phone. As a result you have been issued 
with 7 days of membership credit for each text message you did receive. 
You will only have been charged a quarter of the total cost for each 7 
days.
</a></p><p><a name="paybysms3">
The three main reasons that this occurs are:<br>
</a></p></li><li><a name="paybysms3">There was not enough money on your mobile phone to pay for a full month of membership.
</a></li><li><a name="paybysms3">Your text message inbox was full and so some of the PINs could not be transmitted.

<font color="#ffbb22"><b>I have used the PayBySMS service, but did not receive a PIN</b></font><br>
A PIN is sent to every user who texts the PayBySMS service. We operate a
 Reverse Billing procedure, where you are only charged when we 
successfully send you a PIN. If you did not receive the PIN, then you 
will not have been charged.
