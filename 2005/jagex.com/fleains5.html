<b>Hints And Tips</b><br>
<ul>
<li>If you hold the mouse button down when placing a block where a flea is, the block will be placed as soon as the flea moves out of the way. This lets you place blocks even when an area is crowded with fleas.</li>
<li>Fleas get in each others way, and can even climb over each other. If you have too many fleas together be careful, as they can sometimes overflow out of the confined space they are in. Hint: - On some levels you need to do this to win!</li>
<li>By holding the mouse button down on a bridge, the currently selected block will be placed there as soon as the bridge is destroyed before any fleas can fall through. You can use this tactic with any block which disappears, including bombs.</li>
<li>Sometimes you will find yourself in a situation where you want to place a block when all the fleas are on one side so none get trapped, but the fleas are too spread out. Sometimes when this happens you can squash the fleas into the space you want them to be in, by shrinking the space gradually by placing blocks from the edge towards the middle.</li>
<li>If you get stuck, and can't solve a puzzle don't give up. Every level IS possible! Often a seemingly pointless block will help you win if you think what it might be there for. There are several ways of winning some levels however so you might not have to use every special block every time.</li>
<li>Have fun!
