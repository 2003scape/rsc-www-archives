<h2>How to Play Flea Circus</h2>
Click on the <b>Start New Game</b> button to begin playing
<p>Once you have started the game you will be confronted with a screen split into 2 sections.
The top section is the main playing area. After a short delay you will see the fleas fall out the block marked
with an arrow and begin running backwards and forwards. You must guide them to the exit which
looks like a doorway - to do this you must place blocks and ramps correctly on the screen.
Do this by clicking on which of the 3 shapes at the bottom of the screen you want to place,
then click on the screen where you want to put it. You can use as many of each block as you want,
but there are a few limitations:
<ul>
<li>Blocks can only be placed on empty squares
<li>Blocks cannot be placed where a flea is standing - Wait for it to move away.
<li>A block cannot be removed again except when destroyed by bomb blocks
</ul>
Blocks can be used to bridge gaps, or block ways you don't want the fleas to go. Fleas
can climb up ramps to reach other areas of the level. Fleas are very tough, and don't die
if they fall too far. Be careful however - there are many ways for a flea to die!
