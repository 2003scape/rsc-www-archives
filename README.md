# rsc-www-archives

lightly restored archives of the runescape (classic) website from 2000-2005.
most of the pages are from the
[internet archive's wayback machine](http://web.archive.org).

since `runescape.com` is blocked, i used `runescape.co.uk`, `runescape.net`,
`runescape.org` and the corresponding jagex domains.

### 2003-rev-a

this is the first revision of the website with the stone aesthetic from early
2003.
